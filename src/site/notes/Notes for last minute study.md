	- This will link you to the Litcharts+ pdf for Macbeth, I sourced the majority of my analysis from here so if you're interested you should consider reading it, however they tend to yap a bit so I would recommend my notes instead as I attempted to rectify it certain places where I was motivated enough to do so.
