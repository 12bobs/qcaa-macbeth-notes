Thesis:
In Macbeth, Banquo acts as a character foil to Macbeth, highlighting Macbeth’s moral downfall by embodying restraint, integrity, and scepticism in the face of temptation. Through Banquo’s contrasting reactions to the witches’ prophecies, Shakespeare emphasizes the dangers of unchecked ambition and deceit, using Banquo as a moral counterpoint to illustrate what Macbeth could have been.

- Point: While Macbeth is immediately captivated by the witches’ prophecy of power, Banquo remains sceptical and cautious, showing a stark contrast between the two characters’ responses to temptation. Banquo’s scepticism reveals his integrity and serves to highlight Macbeth’s susceptibility to ambition.
	- Quote 1: "And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths; Win us with honest trifles, to betray's In deepest consequence." (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- Banquo’s warning reflects his understanding that the witches’ prophecies are not to be trusted. His cautious approach contrasts sharply with Macbeth’s eagerness to believe them, underscoring Banquo’s moral restraint and wisdom in the face of potential deceit.
		- Banquo’s use of "instruments of darkness" to describe the witches emphasizes the idea that their truths are dangerous tools of deception, foreshadowing the way they manipulate Macbeth. The metaphor highlights Banquo’s insight and integrity.
		- Shakespeare demonstrates what the "appropriate" response to the supernatural should be: instead of blindly trusting the musings of potentially evil beings, one should instead approach them with heavy scepticism.
	- Quote 2: "If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me." (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- While Macbeth immediately buys into the witches’ prophecies, Banquo’s measured response, asking for more information, shows that he is more cautious and less prone to impulsive ambition. Banquo’s lack of action in response to the witches stands in stark contrast to Macbeth’s reckless pursuit of power.
		- The imagery of "seeds of time" reflects Banquo’s understanding of fate and free will as uncertain, contrasting Macbeth’s deterministic view. This imagery emphasizes Banquo’s wisdom and caution, serving as a moral foil to Macbeth’s rash decisions.
		- Banquo’s metaphor of "seeds of time" suggests that fate, like nature, takes its course, but cannot be forced to grow through human intervention. This reflects his belief that fate is something to be observed, not manipulated.
	- Link to thesis: Banquo’s scepticism toward the witches’ prophecies emphasizes his role as a moral counterpoint to Macbeth, showing the audience what Macbeth could have been if he had exercised restraint. Banquo’s integrity contrasts with Macbeth’s blind ambition, deepening the audience’s understanding of Macbeth’s moral decline. 

- Point: Banquo remains loyal to Duncan and refuses to act on the witches’ prophecies, whereas Macbeth’s growing ambition leads him to deceive and murder Duncan. Banquo’s loyalty and integrity starkly contrast with Macbeth’s betrayal, reinforcing Banquo as a symbol of moral righteousness.
	- Quote 1: "But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings." (Act 3, Scene 1)
		- While Banquo acknowledges the witches’ prophecy about his descendants becoming kings, he does not act on this knowledge, showing his commitment to moral integrity. His passive approach highlights his loyalty to the natural order, in contrast to Macbeth’s active manipulation of fate.
		- The metaphor of Banquo as the "root" and "father" of kings symbolizes his connection to a natural and honourable path, aligning him with moral righteousness and contrasting with the bloody path that Macbeth undertook in order to secure his prophecy.
	- Quote 2: "Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all... and I fear Thou play'dst most foully for't." (Act 3, Scene 1)
		- Banquo’s suspicions about Macbeth’s rise to power underscore his loyalty to the truth and his integrity, as he does not condone Macbeth’s deceptive actions. This quote highlights Banquo’s role as a moral foil, as he refuses to compromise his values, unlike Macbeth, who succumbs to deceit and murder.
		- The alliteration in "play'dst most foully" emphasizes Banquo’s growing distrust of Macbeth, foreshadowing his eventual death due to Macbeth’s increasing paranoia. Banquo’s ethical stance contrasts with Macbeth’s corruption, reinforcing the moral dichotomy between the two.
	- Link to thesis: Banquo’s loyalty and unwillingness to act on the witches’ prophecies contrast sharply with Macbeth’s deceit and betrayal, underscoring Banquo’s role as a foil to Macbeth. His moral righteousness highlights the depths of Macbeth’s moral decay, making Banquo a symbol of integrity for the audience to admire.
