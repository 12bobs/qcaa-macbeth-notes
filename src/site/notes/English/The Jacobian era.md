### Concept:
#### Shakespeare' s intentions due to the setting
- ==very political text,==
- Wrote the play with King James 1st, mainly to placate his desires.
- Shakespeare wanted to warn and dissuade the audience from the consequences of committing regicide or treason; as it both religious and political significance.
- Show the importance of the chain of being and the divine right of kings
- warn the audience of their place in society and their position in the chain of being and why they should not overstep it.
- Raise the awareness of the perils of following [[English/The Supernatural\|The Supernatural]]
- Again relating to the chain of being, he wanted to remind men of their role to lead their household and in part their wife ([[English/Masculinity\|Masculinity]])
#### Reflection on the audience
- Praise of supernatural elements of the plot in the tragedy seen as entertaining and thrilling
- Condemn Macbeth and Lady Macbeth for going against God. They would be judged as selfish, greedy and ambitious.
- Respect and remember their place in society as reinforced by the chain of being that is disturbed in the play 
- reflect on why it is to go against God
- Question the judgment off women; Lady Macbeth and the witches might be seen as responsible for Macbeth's downfall
