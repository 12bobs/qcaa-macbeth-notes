### Concept:
#### Macduff the informed
- Macduff acts as a character foil for Macbeth. Where Macduff acts only after being informed of things happening, Macbeth acts on his suspicions, killing innocents before they have the chance to do any wrong.
- Macduff ends up killing Macbeth out of revenge only after finding out that he ordered the murder of his family, which Macbeth did assuming that his escape to England was a sign of treason.
#### Patriotism
- Macduff is also quite patriotic and acts in the best interests of his country.
- When he decides to take revenge on Macbeth he calls him a "fiend of Scotland" (Act IV Scene III, Line 273).
- This also acts in contrast with Macbeth, as Macbeth doesn't care about what happens to Scotland when he starts climbing the [[English/Christianity and the Chain of Being\|Christianity and the Chain of Being]]
