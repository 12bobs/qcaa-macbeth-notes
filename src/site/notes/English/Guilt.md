### Concept:
#### Guilt and paranoia
- Because Shakespeare was writing for a mainly Christian audience, the theme of guilt is very prevalent. So it makes sense thematically why the heavily ingrained ideals of right and wrong end up winning over a lust for power.
	- Christianity also plays into guilt a lot, as a major 'theme' of Christianity could be seen as guilt. Where one must atone, and to some extent, feel guilty for the sins that they commit. Therefore Shakespeare intertwines this into the play where his characters feel guilty for the sins that they have committed, despite them committing them for their own desires, alluding to some higher presence, or morality, that is making them feel that way. 
- The protagonists of the play frequently suffer over guilt and paranoia. For example, it's a pretty big deal to Macbeth when he can't say 'Amen':
	- "But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'? I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen' Stuck in my throat." - Macbeth, Act II Scene II, Lines 42-44
- This religious allusion emphasises how guilty Macbeth feels, as he's convinced that he is evil as he cannot physically acknowledge god.
- Later on we also see how traumatic it is for Lady Macbeth when she can't remove the imaginary blood on her hands:
	- "Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!" - Lady Macbeth, Act V Scene I, Lines 53-55
- Because the smell of blood lingers on her hands, it's suggested that her guilt isn't leaving. The hyperbole of "all the perfumes in Arabia" proving that what she is experiencing is purely mental, however she later finds a way to 'destroy' the blood lingering in her mind by taking her own life.
- So, Shakespeare tells us, in essence, that the psychological trauma of guilt and paranoia is the consequence of [[English/Ambition\|Ambition]]. It's the hell people end up in for committing such awful acts.

> I am in blood 
> Stepp'd in so far, that, should I wade no more, 
> Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
- After seeing Banquo's ghost, Macbeth seeks to consult the witches on his fate. He points out to his wife that he is too far gone to stop now.
- When Macbeth says "I am in blood" he presents himself as entirely surrounded by murder: instead of causing blood to simply flow from others, he also feels the effects of that violent action--the blood he spilled has surrounded him. ==He clarifies that this is a result of having "Stepp'd in so far" into the metaphorical bloody pool; while "wade no more" signifies that he cannot stay afloat but will drown in the liquid [he is drowning in his guilt].== Therefore Macbeth uses the metaphor of a pool of blood to articulate his ==guilt: he believes that what he has done has sealed his fate and now trying to shift fate is pointless.== The choice of the term "tedious" complicates this, however. Macbeth is in a way saying that he very well could change his behaviour, however to do so would simply be tedious, but he also says that to "go o'er", i.e. continue his current course, would be as tedious. Demonstrating that Macbeth no long finds satisfaction in his path. However, whether out of apathy or inertia, he continues on, but recognises that he could possibly break his destiny if her were a more courageous man.

>Out, damned spot! out, I say!
- Lady Macbeth has begun sleepwalking, and one night she says this.
- We can see the extent to which guilt has crippled Lady Macbeth's ability to live a normal life. Saying this lines shows that while she thought that before she could simply wash off Duncan's blood, now she cannot psychologically escape the blood, or in other words, the guilt of Duncan's murder. She obsessively repeats the action, demonstrating the extent to which the guilt weighs on her mind, as well as her fear that the "spot" could implicate her in the murder.

>Is this a dagger which I see before me, 
>The handle toward my hand? 
>Come, let me clutch thee; 
>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. 
>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 
>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but 
>A dagger of the mind, a false creation, 
>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? 
>I see thee yet, in form as palpable 
>As this which now I draw
- Macbeth before murdering Duncan
- A primarily psychological analysis of this lines would reveal the first signs of Macbeth's insanity. His inability to distinguish between a physical and imaginary dagger does not prevent him from hoping to "clutch" either one. When he cannot, he notes that it is impossible to "have" the vision, and yet that he can still "see" it, and is confused why his sense of sight and touch do not accord. Macbeth recognises the conditions of his sanity, ==observing that his "heat-oppressed brain" may be responsible for creating the illusion, or in other words he thinks his guilt may be causing him to see things==. Yet after noting this he still reiterates the "palpable" nature of the dagger, comparing it to the physical world.
	- The symbolism of the dagger is used in order to demonstrate the guilt that Macbeth feels even before committing the act

> Stars, hide your fires! 
> Let not light see my black and deep desires.
- After finding out that Duncan will be coming to his castle, Macbeth fantasises about murdering him and seizing the throne for himself. He wishes to obscure these thoughts from outside observers by asking the stars to hide darken.
- At this early point in the play Macbeth is still unsure whether or not he wants to go through with his plot to murder Duncan. He remains careful of his desires and has a sense of paranoia surrounding the threat of someone finding this out, therefore he calls upon the stars to "hide your fires" so that no one will see his "black and deep desires." The quote here plays upon common themes and metaphors of light and dark, however in this case the colours can be interpreted in a different way: black obviously alludes to his morally unscrupulousness, however 'light' does not stand in for an opposite. Rather it acts as a biblical allusion, where light is a stand in for an observer, in this case God, playing upon visions of God as a being of 'light.' Therefore it seems that Macbeth is less concerned about other human beings will spy his desires, but rather that he will receive some divine punishment because of it.
	- Macbeth feels guilty for his desires as he feels that he has made some sin by feeling that way, hence why he asks the stars to hide his desires.

> Methought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more! 
> Macbeth does murder sleep, â€” the innocent sleep; 
> Sleep, that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care, 
> The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 
> Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, 
> Chief nourisher in life's feast.
- After murdering Duncan, Macbeth begins to feel remorse for what he has done. he fixates on a voice he claims to have overheard during the act, believing that it charges him with deep guilt.
- This quote servers to highlight Macbeth's continued descent into madness due to his growing guilt. His previous hallucinations that manifested due to his guilt have now progressed to the point where he is now able to hear them as well. Macbeth states that he heard "a voice cry, Sleep no more!" This line acts as a double entendre: not only has Macbeth murdered someone while they were in "the innocent sleep," but now with the guilt of having committed such a crime, Macbeth shall no longer be able to sleep. The quote goes onto describe the consequences that having committed this crime will have, such as, "the balm of hurt minds" and "sore labor's bath." By emphasizing these qualities, the audience can come to see the path towards insanity that Macbeth has placed himself on.
- Further explanation from Litcharts:
	- He imagines it to be a weaver who "knits up" or makes coherent and composed "the ravell'd sleave of care"--in which a "ravell'd sleave" is a messy and disorganized garment. This metaphor presents sleep as a tranquil and organising force that helps a person make coherent the chaos of life, that allows people to be coherent and calm. In the following lines, he casts sleep as the inverse or double to different types of daytime: the "death" after each "life"; the restful "bath" after one works; the "balm" to ease minds that may be overworked; a second sustenance after the meal of the day. These evocative images show how deeply Macbeth believes to have violated human life--for not only has he murdered Duncan but he has done so in an almost sacred space of sleeping rejuvenation. As Macbeth's obsessive thoughts on sleep proceed, an intimation exists too that "Sleep no more!" refers to the rampant guilt and madness that will descend now on Macbeth and his wife, in which because of their guilt, they will lose these healthful and necessary effects of sleep.

>Nought's had, all's spent 
>Where our desire is got without content.
- Lady Macbeth ponders why she continues to be dissatisfied with her existence. She acknowledges that she has had complete success in her endeavours but somehow remains vexed.
- These lines reveal a change in Lady Macbeth's disposition. Whereas before, she believed that he murder of Duncan would generate positive results, here she concludes the exact opposite. "Nought's had, all's spent" must be taken metaphorically--because Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have in fact achieved their goal of becoming king and queen. The line also elaborates on her disposition, where she feels that she has given everything that she can, but has received nothing in return. Lady Macbeth states that the trade-off of political power in exchange for "content," which we can take to mean "guilt-free contentment," wasn't at all worth it.
- Beyond revealing a growing dissatisfaction in Lady Macbeth, this passage makes a broader claim on the trappings of power and fame. Lady Macbeth points out that the status she had pursued does not in fact grant her happiness, but rather has brought her into greater misfortune. Thus Shakespeare uses her psychological anxiety as a way to illustrate the self-defeating natures of ambition and desire.
