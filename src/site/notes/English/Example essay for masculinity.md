Thesis:
In Macbeth, Shakespeare presents masculinity as a positive and necessary trait when aligned with strength, honor, and justice, especially in male characters like Macduff and Macbeth. However, when Lady Macbeth invokes masculinity, it is associated with unnatural and sinister ambitions, subverting traditional gender roles and the natural order, reflecting Jacobean values such as the Great Chain of Being.

- Point: Shakespeare presents masculinity in male characters, especially in figures like Macduff and Macbeth (before his corruption), as a force that upholds honor, strength, and justice. This masculine ideal is shown to be essential for maintaining moral integrity and societal order.
	- Quote 1: "I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me." (Act 4, Scene 3)
		- The juxtaposition between "feeling it as a man" and acting in vengeance highlights the balance between masculine emotional expression and decisive action, aligning with Jacobean ideals of masculinity being about both moral responsibility and strength.
		- Macduff's response to Malcom after hearing of his family's murder illustrates the complexity of masculinity in the play. Macduff believes that he must feel his grief for his family through violence directed towards the tyrant responsible for their murders, Macbeth. In this sense, Malcom's rage over the murder of his family, and therefore masculinity, is depicted as a positive force towards achieving justice.
		- By placing Macduff in the position of a protagonist and depicting his masculinity through loyalty both his country and family, Shakespeare plays upon the audiences own conceptions of masculinity in order to deter them from acts of treason, which would have been a common fear during the Jacobian era due to events like the Gunpowder plot.
	- Quote 2: "I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none." (Act 1, Scene 7)
		- Macbeth says that he will only "do all that may become a man"-- a pun on become meaning both to turn into something, as well as a characteristic that proceeds oneself. In effect, Macbeth is saying that his actions are done to become more masculine, but also as a way to give the illusion of masculinity. Macbeth reasons, he would not be a man if he were betray Duncan, for he would have overstepped the acceptable boundaries that traditionally describe manhood. In this way, Macbeth describes masculinity as a limit on his actions, through justice and loyalty, contrasting with the reckless ambition he later succumbs to.
	- Link to thesis: Through characters like Macduff and early Macbeth, Shakespeare affirms a positive vision of masculinity as a combination of emotional depth, strength, and honor, aligned with the Jacobean concept of natural order, where true manhood is virtuous and restrained.

- Point: In contrast, Shakespeare presents Lady Macbeth’s use of masculinity as sinister and unnatural. By attempting to reject her femininity and take on masculine qualities, she subverts traditional gender roles and challenges the natural order, making her ambition appear dangerous and destructive.
	- Quote 1: "Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty!" (Act 1, Scene 5)
		- Unsex me here is a metaphor for her desire to be rid of feminine characteristics.
		- Lady Macbeth believes that supernatural forces have a corruptive effect on human nature, therefore she demands that she be overtaken by them as she wishes to act cruelly so that she may transcend her moral boundaries as to act out her ambition.
		- Her desire to rid herself of her feminine traits also emphasises the extent of her ambition through its relation to the Chain of Being. According to Christianity, the role/s that you are born with are essential to your being as they would have essentially been chosen by God Himself. Therefore by having Lady Macbeth attempt to remove a role as essential as her femineity, Shakespeare is illustrating to the audience just how unchecked her ambition is where she is willing to go against God.
	- Quote 2: "When you durst do it, then you were a man; […] you would so much more the man" (Act 1, Scene 7)
		- Lady Macbeth manipulates Macbeth’s sense of masculinity, equating manhood with violence and ambition. Her cynical use of masculinity contrasts with the positive, honorable masculinity seen in male characters, and her actions ultimately lead to chaos, aligning her with the unnatural and the sinful.
		- The irony in Lady Macbeth’s assertion that Macbeth would be more of a man by committing murder reveals how her warped view of masculinity is at odds with the honorable ideals Shakespeare associates with male characters. Her manipulation subverts the natural roles of men and women in Jacobean society.
	- Link to thesis: Lady Macbeth’s attempt to adopt masculine traits for the purpose of committing violence represents an unnatural and sinister ambition, reinforcing Shakespeare’s portrayal of masculinity as positive only when it is aligned with justice and moral order, not when it is corrupted by immoral desires.
