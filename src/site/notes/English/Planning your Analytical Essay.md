- To best succeed, we'll start from the planning stage, something you should do well before writing your essay.
- Respond to the question by writing a thesis
- Makes sure that you scribble down the point of each of your three paragraphs briefly, including 1-2 example quotes. Most importantly, be sure to write underneath the type of **literary techniques** that said quotes use
- This will mean you'll have identified most of the elements that make up your paragraph since the planning stage. By the time you'll get to the body paragraph, all you'll have to do is expand on them.
- You can use direct, or indirect quotes. i.e. direct reference to a quote, vs an indirect explanation of the quote.
- **Historically** there have been questions on characters and themes.
