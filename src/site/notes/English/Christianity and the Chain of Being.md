### Concept:
#### The Chain of Being
- The idea that God created a hierarchy of all things, living and non-living
- In the same way how it would be considered strange and possibly sinful, for a mineral to become a plant, it was also seen as sinful for a peasant to become a nobleman.
- Or in the case of Macbeth, for a nobleman to escape their rank and become king
- Kings were seen as having a special position within this chain of being, and therefore regicide was one of the most severe sins in existence.
- Therefore by committing regicide one commits themselves to hell by directly violating the divine order.
