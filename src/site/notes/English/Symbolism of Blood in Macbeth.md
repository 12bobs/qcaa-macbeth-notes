### Concept:
#### Blood in Macbeth
- blood is used as a symbol of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's [[English/Guilt\|guilt]], with the violence of their actions  staining them both mentally and physically.
- Blood itself--the colour, the smell, and importance--is vital to life and shocking to see. The constant presence of blood in *Macbeth* repeatedly reminds the audience about how serious the consequences of the characters actions are. But almost surpassing the importance of physical blood is the imagined blood found throughout the play. Imaginary blood represents guilt for Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. It's not until after the murder of Duncan that their guilt begins to manifest. As their guilt grows, so does the importance of the blood. 
- What's more, the imaginary blood also shows how Macbeth and Lady Macbeth both lose a grasp on reality. Often quoted as the fact that Lady Macbeth cannot get the imagined blood off her hands nor can her husband. Their guilt is all consuming and inescapable. The imagined blood haunts both characters, following them until their death.

> I am in blood 
> Stepp'd in so far, that, should I wade no more, 
> Returning were as tedious as go o'er.
- After seeing Banquo's ghost, Macbeth seeks to consult the witches on his fate. He points out to his wife that he is too far gone to stop now.
- When Macbeth says "I am in blood" he presents himself as entirely surrounded by murder: instead of causing blood to simply flow from others, he also feels the effects of that violent action--the blood he spilled has surrounded him. He clarifies that this is a result of having "Stepp'd in so far" into the metaphorical bloody pool; while "wade no more" signifies that he cannot stay afloat but will drown in the liquid. Therefore Macbeth uses the metaphor of a pool of blood to articulate his guilt: he believes that what he has done has sealed his fate and now trying to shift fate is pointless. The choice of the term "tedious" complicates this, however. Macbeth is in a way saying that he very well could change his behaviour, however to do so would simply be tedious, but he also says that to "go o'er", i.e. continue his current course, would be as tedious. Demonstrating that Macbeth no long finds satisfaction in his path. However, whether out of apathy or inertia, he continues on, but recognises that he could possibly break his destiny if her were a more courageous man.

>Out, damned spot! out, I say!
- Lady Macbeth has begun sleepwalking, and one night she says this.
- We can see the extent to which guilt has crippled Lady Macbeth's ability to live a normal life. Saying this lines shows that while she thought that before she could simply wash off Duncan's blood, now she cannot psychologically escape the blood, or in other words, the guilt of Duncan's murder. She obsessively repeats the action, demonstrating the extent to which the guilt weighs on her mind, as well as her fear that the "spot" could implicate her in the murder.
