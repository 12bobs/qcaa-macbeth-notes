Thesis:
In Macbeth, Shakespeare demonstrates how unchecked ambition becomes a destructive force, leading individuals to forsake their morals, spiral into guilt, and ultimately, self-destruction. Through the characters of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, the play highlights the perilous consequences of overreaching ambition and its corrupting influence on the human soul.

- Point: Macbeth’s ambition drives him to commit regicide and subsequently leads to a series of violent acts. Initially conflicted, his desire for power soon overtakes his moral judgment, pushing him down a path of irreversible corruption.
	- Quote 1: "I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other." (Act 1, Scene 7)
		- The metaphor of "vaulting ambition" likens ambition to a horse leaping too high and failing, illustrating how Macbeth’s desire for power exceeds his capacity for ethical restraint, setting him up for failure.
		- What is intriguing about this passage is that Macbeth seems keenly aware of his motivations and limitations. Though he may be acting out of "vaulting ambition," he can still critically assess what stimulates him to act, and its likely consequences. Yet at the same time he will still ignore this scepticism and indeed "o'erleap" himself.
		- Shakespeare thus provides the audience with a complex view of Macbeth's psychology; even though he is aware of his own flaws, namely his unchecked ambition, he still falls prey to them in the end,
	- Quote 2: "I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er." (Act 3, Scene 4)
		- Macbeth's metaphor of a "wading" through a pool of blood is representative of the violence that Macbeth has had to take in order to reach his position. The use of the word "wading" also points to the fact that it was because of Macbeth's own free will that he is now where he is; rather than having been pushed by fate, he has waded into this pit of violence.
		- Macbeth acknowledges that it is because of his own actions that he is in this predicament, however he believes that "should [he] wade no more" he could return, however to do so would require as much effort as to continue on his current path. His decision to instead continue killing rather than return to morality demonstrates how his belief in controlling fate has spiralled into destruction, driven by his own free will and ambition.
		- Shakespeare is making commentary on the violent nature of ambition, and the deadly consequences of going against Gods will.
	- Link to thesis: Macbeth’s unchecked ambition transforms him from a hesitant, morally conflicted character into a tyrant consumed by guilt and paranoia, illustrating Shakespeare’s warning about the dangers of overreaching ambition.

- Point: Lady Macbeth's ambition is equally destructive, as her desire for power leads her to manipulate Macbeth into murdering Duncan. However, the guilt that follows consumes her, driving her into madness and ultimately to her death.
		- Quote 1: "Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty!" (Act 1, Scene 5)
		- Unsex me here is a metaphor for her desire to be rid of feminine characteristics.
		- Lady Macbeth invokes dark forces to rid herself of feminine qualities like compassion and kindness, demonstrating her willingness to abandon morality to achieve power. This reflects how her ambition fuels her desire for ruthless action.
		- Her desire to rid herself of her feminine traits also emphasises the extent of her ambition through its relation to the Chain of Being. According to Christianity, the role/s that you are born with are essential to your being as they would have essentially been chosen by God Himself. Therefore by having Lady Macbeth attempt to remove a role as essential as her femineity, Shakespeare is illustrating to the audience just how unchecked her ambition is where she is willing to go against God.
	- Quote 2: "Out, damned spot! out, I say!" (Act 5, Scene 1)
		- The "spot" represents Lady Macbeth’s guilt, an inescapable mark of her complicity in Duncan’s murder. Her inability to rid herself of this guilt illustrates the psychological cost of her ambition.
		- This quote reveals the extent to which guilt has crippled Lady Macbeth's ability to live a normal life. Whereas before she believed that she could simply physically wash away Duncan's blood, now her psyche is stained by the guilt of his murder; her plea for supernatural strength turning into a curse as her mind is consumed by guilt. 
		- Lady Macbeth’s hallucination of a bloodstain she cannot wash away symbolizes the guilt and psychological torment that follow her ambition-driven actions. Her descent into madness demonstrates how ambition, once unchecked, leads to psychological collapse.
	- Link to thesis: Lady Macbeth’s ambition initially propels her to push Macbeth toward murder, but the weight of her guilt ultimately drives her to madness, reinforcing Shakespeare’s message that unchecked ambition leads to self-destruction.
