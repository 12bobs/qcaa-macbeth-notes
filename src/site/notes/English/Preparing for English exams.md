#### General considerations for the QCAA English Analytical Essay
- There are a few unwritten rules hat must be followed to make you sure produce a top notch essays!
- Firstly, never write in first person (I or me), but always in third person (The reader, the writer) as this is meant to be a formal piece of writing.
- The second most important thing here is to always write in the present tense, rather than in the past tense. The writer uses or does something, rather than used or did. Even if it was written in the past, you should still make the essay in the present tense, because it is in the NOW THAT YOU'RE ANALYSING IT.
- Some exam advice here: the conditions stipulate that your essay must be 800 to 1000 words. Add another evidence body paragraph if you see you're running short.
