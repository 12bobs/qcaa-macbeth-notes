Thesis:
In Macbeth, Shakespeare uses supernatural elements, such as the witches, apparitions, and hallucinations, to blur the lines between reality and the supernatural, ultimately reflecting the characters’ inner turmoil and the destructive consequences of unchecked ambition.

- Point: The witches represent the supernatural manipulation of fate and introduce the theme of moral ambiguity, influencing Macbeth’s ambition and leading him down a destructive path.
	- Quote 1: "Fair is foul, and foul is fair." (Act 1, Scene 1)
		- The quote is an example of chiasmus, using the words "fair" and "foul" in the form ABBA in order to create a rhythmical and almost otherworldly sense to the witches that represents their supernatural origins.
		- This paradox sets the tone for the entire play, indicating that appearances are not what they seem, and that moral boundaries will blur; and with the introduction of this idea, it in turn represents how Macbeth's perception of right and wrong will be shaped throughout the play.
		- The mixing of the terms fair and foul also have connotations for Shakespeare's message of the supernatural; even if the supernatural is ultimately foul, it has qualities of fairness as well.
	- Quote 2: "All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!" (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- The chanting of the Witches plays upon Macbeths ambition for power and ultimately pushes Macbeth to first consider murdering the king.
		- The whole scene works as foreshadowing, where the witches chant obviously foreshadows Macbeth's rise to become king, but the witches themselves, being symbols of evil, act as an allusion to the tragic fate that will accompany Macbeth
		- The supernatural was seen as evil and devilish, therefore for Macbeth to consort with them he must not be of sound moral stature himself.
	- Link to thesis: The witches blur the line between fate and free will, sowing seeds of ambition in Macbeth, and initiating his moral corruption, as they represent the supernatural forces beyond human control that drive him towards destruction.

- Point: Macbeth’s supernatural visions, such as the floating dagger and Banquo’s ghost, symbolize his growing guilt and unravelling sanity as a result of his unchecked ambition.
	- Quote 1: "Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?" (Act 2, Scene 1)
		- Soliloquy
		- This scene acts as one of the first examples to the audience that Macbeth may be going insane, where he gradually loses the ability to distinguish the physical from the imaginary. Macbeth recognises the conditions of his sanity, observing that his "heat-oppressed brain" may be responsible for creating the illusion, or in other words, he believes that the shear friction of his guilt against his psyche has manifested an illusion. Regardless of the tangibility of the dagger, Macbeth still describes it with a "palpable" quality, comparing it to the physical world. And when Macbeth does "draw" his own sword, he implies that it may have a causal effect on his actions. Shakespeare thus presents false visions not as figments of the imagination, but as capable of inducing changes to reality itself.
	- Quote 2: "Thou canst not say I did it: never shake Thy gory locks at me!" (Act 3, Scene 4)
		- Like the Dagger, Banquo's ghost embodies Macbeth's guilt and paranoia following his treacherous actions. This supernatural encounter forces Macbeth to confront the moral consequences  of his ambition, further driving him toward madness.
		- Shakespeare beings to develop the consequences of Macbeth's ambition, acting as a cautionary message against unchecked ambition for his audience.
	- Link to thesis: The supernatural visions reflect Macbeth’s internal guilt and descent into madness, highlighting how ambition leads to moral decay and aligning with the play’s exploration of internal conflict and corruption.

- Point: Lady Macbeth invokes the supernatural to strip herself of feminine weakness and guilt, yet she ultimately falls victim to overwhelming remorse, showing how ambition distorts her moral compass.
	- Quote 1: "Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty!" (Act 1, Scene 5)
		- Unsex me here is a metaphor for her desire to be rid of feminine characteristics.
		- Lady Macbeth believes that supernatural forces have a corruptive effect on human nature, therefore she demands that she be overtaken by them as she wishes to act cruelly so that she may transcend her moral boundaries as to act out her ambition.
		- Her desire to rid herself of her feminine traits also emphasises the extent of her ambition through its relation to the Chain of Being. According to Christianity, the role/s that you are born with are essential to your being as they would have essentially been chosen by God Himself. Therefore by having Lady Macbeth attempt to remove a role as essential as her femineity, Shakespeare is illustrating to the audience just how unchecked her ambition is where she is willing to go against God.
	- Quote 2: "Out, damned spot! out, I say!" (Act 5, Scene 1)
		- The repetition and exclamation of Lady Macbeth's words reveals the extent of her insanity, desperately trying to wash away a spot of blood that does not exist.
		- This quote reveals the extent to which guilt has crippled Lady Macbeth's ability to live a normal life. Whereas before she believed that she could simply physically wash away Duncan's blood, now her psyche is stained by the guilt of his murder; her plea for supernatural strength turning into a curse as her mind is consumed by guilt. 
		- Shakespeare elaborates on the same consequences that are seen with Macbeth--both symbolised by blood--where due to Lady Macbeth's meddling with supernatural forces and playing with God's will, she is now suffering an almost divine punishment
	- Link to thesis: Lady Macbeth’s invocation of supernatural forces and her subsequent guilt demonstrate the destructive power of ambition, as the supernatural both enables her initial ruthlessness and punishes her with overwhelming remorse, mirroring Macbeth’s internal conflict.
