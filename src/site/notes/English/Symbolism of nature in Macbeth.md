#### Symbolism of nature in Macbeth
- Throughout Shakespeare's *Macbeth*, the weather plays an important role. The rebelling nature of wind and lightning indicates the disruption within the natural order of society. It makes it seem  as if the weather is upset with Macbeth's actions. In many Shakespearean plays--including this one-- rebelling nature shows a departure from accepted political and moral order
