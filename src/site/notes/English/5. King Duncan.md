### Concept:
#### Duncan as Ideal King
- Duncan is everything as a ruler that Macbeth is not; Kind, compassionate, fair, and trustworthy.
- In Act I Scene VII, Macbeth himself says that King Duncan was "So clear in his great office, that His virtues/Will plead like angels" (Lines 18-19) when he finally dies.
#### Trust
- Another point of difference between the two is that Duncan is trusting. He puts his faith in Macbeth and his wife as good rulers, fair people and kind hosts.
- Macbeth trusts nobody, which is what makes him susceptible to paranoia and more eager to kill anyone he perceives as a threat
