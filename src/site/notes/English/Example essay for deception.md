Thesis:
In Macbeth, Shakespeare explores the theme of deception to illustrate how characters use manipulation and lies to achieve their ambitions, often with disastrous consequences. Through figures like Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, and the witches, the play demonstrates how deceit distorts reality, leading to the downfall of those who use it.

- Point: The witches manipulate Macbeth through ambiguous and deceptive prophecies, planting the seeds of ambition and allowing Macbeth to interpret their words in a way that leads to his downfall.
	- Quote 1: "Fair is foul, and foul is fair." (Act 1, Scene 1)
		- The quote is an example of chiasmus, using the words "fair" and "foul" in the form ABBA in order to create a rhythmical and almost otherworldly sense to the witches that represents their supernatural origins.
		- This paradox sets the tone for the entire play, indicating that appearances are not what they seem, and that moral boundaries will blur; and with the introduction of this idea, it in turn represents how Macbeth's perception of right and wrong will be shaped throughout the play.
		- The mixing of the terms fair and foul also have connotations for Shakespeare's message of the supernatural; even if the supernatural is ultimately foul, it has qualities of fairness as well.
	- Quote 2: "All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!" (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- The witches’ prophecy of Macbeth’s rise to kingship is deceptively simple, leading Macbeth to believe that fate will ensure his ascension. However, this prophecy manipulates him into taking actions that will ultimately lead to his ruin, showing how the witches use half-truths to deceive.
		- The whole scene works as foreshadowing, where the witches chant obviously foreshadows Macbeth's rise to become king, but the witches themselves, being symbols of evil, act as an allusion to the tragic fate that will accompany Macbeth.
		- The supernatural was seen as evil and devilish, therefore for Macbeth to consort with them he must not be of sound moral stature himself.
	- Link to thesis: The witches’ deceptive prophecies, filled with ambiguity and half-truths, manipulate Macbeth into taking fateful actions, illustrating Shakespeare’s message that deception distorts one’s perception of reality, leading to catastrophic consequences.

- Point: Lady Macbeth uses deception to manipulate Macbeth into murdering Duncan, hiding her true intentions behind a façade of support and ruthlessness while encouraging Macbeth to do the same.
	- Quote 1: "Look like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under't." (Act 1, Scene 5)
		- These lines return to the theme of appearance vs reality. While Macbeth is still uncertain as to whether or not to kill Duncan, Lady Macbeth is fully committed to the idea. She contrasts the image of the "innocent flower" with the active corruption of "the serpent," much like the witches mixed up "fair" and "foul" in the beginning of the play. For her however, this does not express a general predicament, but instead an outline to gain political power.
		- Referencing the serpent acts as a biblical allusion to the garden of Eden, where Satan, disguised as a snake, tempts Eve into committing the original sin. This plays into the same deception that Lady Macbeth is employing, where in this case she is tempting Macbeth to commit his 'original sin' that will set him down his dark path.
	- Quote 2: "False face must hide what the false heart doth know." (Act 1, Scene 7)
		- Macbeth echoes Lady Macbeth’s advice, acknowledging the need to conceal his guilt and ambition with a “false face.” This highlights how deception becomes central to their plan, as both characters understand that they must deceive others in order to achieve their goals.
		- The repetition of "false" emphasizes the theme of deception, while the metaphor of the “false face” illustrates the act of masking one’s true intentions behind a façade, revealing the extent of Macbeth’s moral decline.
	- Link to thesis: Lady Macbeth’s manipulation of Macbeth through deceptive advice highlights how both characters use deceit as a tool to achieve their ambitions, ultimately leading to moral corruption and chaos, reinforcing Shakespeare’s warning about the destructive power of deception.
