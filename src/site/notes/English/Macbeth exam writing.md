#### Macbeth exam writing
- Your analysis for your quotes should consist of three parts:

1. How it links back to the thesis
2. The language features the quote e1mploys and how that affects the meaning and possibly how it relates to surrounding concepts (thesis, context [i.e. biblical allusions, etc.])
3. The context that Shakespeare is writing in. For example, how it relates to Christianity, or the message that he's telling the audience.

- Something you’ll also note about the way that I’ve structured the ‘essays’ is that I’ve only used two paragraphs, I would recommend that you do the same in your exams because; for one, you won’t get marked down because of it; and two, you’ll be able to put more effort into those two paragraphs rather than spreading it out between 3, which should help with getting a higher grade. Of course, there are certain these and questions where having 3 paragraphs will be superior (like the essay on the supernatural) however if you can help it, avoid writing 3 paragraphs.
