#### Preface
- This shouldn't be used as a 1:1 guide for your essays, instead it should be used in order to put certain quotes in context for their respective themes. Obviously in the exam it's unlikely that there will be a question that’s strictly about a certain theme, instead it usually incorporates some other aspect that needs to be analysed, therefore these paragraphs should be used in order to see how certain quotes can be put into a broader exam question. There should also be another document attached to this from Litcharts that contains proper analysis of quotes.
- Additionally, I mainly put together stuff that I thought would be valuable memorising, which is why I haven’t included exams on characters such as Lady Macbeth or Macbeth. There is enough content within these paragraphs where if you remember the quotes, you should be able to put together an essay anyway. However, if you do want me to put something together just send me a DM on insta.
