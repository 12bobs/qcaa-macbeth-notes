### Concept:
#### Honour and bravery
- honour and bravery were ingrained values during Shakespeare's time, especially among the nobility, strongly pertaining to [[English/Christianity and the Chain of Being\|Christianity and the Chain of Being]], as they believed that they a duty to ensure they were of 'good character' as they were 'closer' to God.
#### Macbeth's Honour
- Over the course of the play Macbeth gradually loses the good aspects of himself such as his honour, as he commits worse and worse crimes, from murdering his friends then to innocent women and children.
- Shakespeare makes Macbeth's loss of honour very obvious by comparing him to King Duncan in lines 122 and 127, with Macbeth being called an "untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd" and Duncan as "a most  sainted king".
#### Macbeth's bravery
- Macbeth's bravery also diminishes throughout the course of the play, where in the final act he had practically locked himself away in his castle, terrified to leave despite thinking that he's invincible.
- Nor by the end, does he have the bravery to commit his own crimes, where he gets other people to do them.
- So while we associate these values with the **ideal Jacobean nobleman**, these traits ultimately belong more to characters like Banquo and Macduff than to Macbeth. And since Macbeth lacks these values, Shakespeareâ€™s audience (and us, too) would find it easy to dislike him.
