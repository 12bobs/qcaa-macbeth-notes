- Deception is the means by which the Macbeths achieve their ends.
- This is obvious early in the play when Macbeth and his wife conspire to climb the royal hierarchy.
- In Act I Scene V, Lady Macbeth advises her husband to:
	- Look like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under't" - Lady Macbeth, Act 1 Scene V, Lines 76-77
- The reason this metaphor is so disturbing is because it features a distinctive contrast between an "innocent flower" and a "serpent". (also a biblical illusion referring to the devil)
- The idea of deception eventually becomes a key aspect of Macbeth's character.
- Macbeth speaks about requiring deception to meet his aims just before killing the King:
	- "false face must hide what the false doth know." - Macbeth, Act I Scene VII, Line 95
- A "false heart" carries connotations of evil.
- After countless "strategic" murders, he eventually gains a reputation for being a backstabber. 
- We see this in Act IV Scene III, where Malcom characterises him as:
	- "False, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name." - Malcom, Act IV Scene III, Liens 71-73
- Considering the values of [[English/Honour and bravery\|Honour and bravery]] that were significant in the Jacobean era, the additional flaw of deceitfulness would have made Macbeth's character even more despicable.
- This is made more obvious by the character foils of [[English/3. Banquo\|3. Banquo]] and [[English/4. Macduff\|4. Macduff]], who are known for [[English/Honour and bravery\|Honour and bravery]]
- The act of causing someone to accept as true or valid what is false or 'invalid'
- "look like the innocent flower but be the serpent under it"
	- simile or metaphor as comparing two things 
- "Fair is foul and foul is fair"
	- Chiasmus
- Uses as a main theme in his play. He suggests living a life of deceit will inevitably lead to the downfall of an individual if they allow lies to consume them.
- Macbeth lies to Baanquo about acting on the prophecies of the three witches, claiming he 'Thinks not of them"
- Macbeth deceives himself by believing in what the witches said
- Lady Macbeth was able to make others believe she is a 'gentle lady'

> Look like the innocent flower, 
> But be the serpent under it.
-  Lady Macbeth entreats her husband to kill Duncan. She implores him to act secretly but strike violently.
- These lines return to the theme of appearance vs reality. While Macbeth is still uncertain as to whether or not to kill Duncan, Lady Macbeth is fully committed to the idea. She contrasts the image of the "innocent flower" with the active corruption of "the serpent," much like the witches mixed up "fair" and "foul" in the beginning of the play. For her however, this does not express a general predicament, but instead an outline to gain political power.
- Referencing a serpent is also a biblical allusion to the garden of Eden in the bible, in which a snake tempts Eve and leads to humanity's expulsion from paradise. This Christ reference is especially evocative of considering Lady Macbeth's engagement with supernatural paganism: just as she summoned the aid of fiends, Lady Macbeth symbolically asks her husband to strike out against Christian ideals--to take the role of a Biblical Villain.
	- This also directly parallels what occurs in the play, where after murdering Duncan, Satan is invited into Macbeth's castle, symbolising his fall from grace.
