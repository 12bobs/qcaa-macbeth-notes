### Concept:
#### Roles or people in Shakespeare's characters
- Are Shakespeare's characters complex psychological people or just archetypical characters
- Psychology has changed dramatically over the years, where now we see people as complex individuals with personalities that extend past their labels, then people were more so perceived as the roles they inhabited, i.e. noble, peasant, etc. 
	- you do not define your role - your role defines you
- Important to consider whether or not to analyse a character as an individual person or as their role
