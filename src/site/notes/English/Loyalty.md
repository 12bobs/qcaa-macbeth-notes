### Concept:
#### Loyalty
- Loyalty was another mark of a good nobleman in the Jacobean era. This can be seen through Macbeth early in the play with the line
	- "We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honour'd me of late [...]" - Macbeth, Act 1 Scene VII, Lines 34-35
	- Gives Macbeth an imperative tone, highlighting how strong his loyalty to the king is.
- Loyalty also extends to a more patriotic kind of loyalty, the kind that encouraged Malcom and Macduff to return to Scotland and rid the country of Macbeth.
- Like with the punishments that come with betrayal, disloyalty was also punished as a way to dissuade people from treason
