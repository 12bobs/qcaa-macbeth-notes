### Concept:
#### Ambition
- The play was written shortly after the gunpowder plot ([[English/History of King James I\|History of King James I]]), an ambitious attempt on the King's life. This similarities between this reality and the one in Macbeth are demonstrated by how Lady Macbeth exposes us to Macbeth's aim to kill the king:
	- "What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan?" - Lady Macbeth, Act I Scene VII, Lines 79-80
- The word "unguarded" connotes weakness and vulnerability. So we can see that the Macbeth's already see themselves as more powerful than the King. Making it clear that the connection between the Gunpowder Plot and Macbeths' is excessive ambition. With Macbeth telling us as much in the same scene:
	- "I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition [...]" - Macbeth, Act I Scene VII, Lines 25-27
		- the use of vaulting to personify how ambitious he really is.
- Secondly, Macbeth is centred around social hierarchies, which tend to breed ambition. In Act I Scene III, we are exposed to the ladder of Scottish royalty in the witches' prophecies:
	- "First witch: All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!"
	- "Second witch: All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, than of Cawdor!"
	- "Third witch: All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!"
		-- the witches, Act I Scene III, Lines 51-53
- But there was also the more philosophical hierarchy of the chain of being, which strongly implies against ambition in that construct. As people should stay where they are in accordance with the chain, as that was how God made it. To have ambition to go against it and rise one status was sinful.
- the destruction wrought when ambition goes unchecked by moral constraints.
- excessive, extreme or uncontrollable desire for success, power or wealth

- "Thou wouldst be great art not without ambition, but without the illness should attend it"
- "gainst nature still! Triffless ambition, that will ravin up. Thine own lives means! Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth."

- After leaning that King Duncan will be staying at Macbeth's castle, she begins plotting his demise, asking the spirits to relinquish her of her human compassion to carry out the deed.
- According to [[English/Christianity and the Chain of Being\|Christianity and the Chain of Being]], the role/s that you are born with are essential to your being as it would have been essentially chosen by God Himself. Therefore with Lady Macbeth's decision to go against this and become in essence, masculine, she is demonstrating the extent of her ambition by even daring to go against God.

>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
>The instruments of darkness tell us truths, 
>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's 
>In deepest consequence.
- Macbeth and Banquo have just learned that Macbeth will become the thane of Cawdor, which confirms the first part of the witches prophecy, Banquo notes that the stories told by the witches may be an attempt to manipulate Macbeth.
- These lines pose an important question about the supernatural at the start of the play: are these men able to escape the witches prophecies, or are they bound by fate to walk down the road set before them? When Banquo says they "win us to our harm," he contends that the witches are actively exploiting him and Macbeth, yet he also note that they "tell us truths"--which would seem to imply that nothing they recount is false. The resolution comes in a similarly paradoxical phrase: "Honest trifles" that "betray." What Banquo means is that aspects of the witches prophecies are genuine, but that they are meant to instead play upon their better nature as a way to manipulate or "betray" themselves.
- Banquo thus argues that he and Macbeth should resist believing the witches too much, despite their prophecies being correct so far. This belief posits a worldview in which humans can act freely from the influence of supernatural forces--choosing to believe them or not. Macbeth, n the other hand, represents the position that direct adherence to their prophecies will allow him to thwart his fate. Shakespeare thus uses these two characters mixed responses to present two different ways of viewing the supernatural forces in his work: as either manoeuvring or merely recounting fate. 
- The witches are attempting to manipulate Macbeth and Banquo by telling half-truths and playing on their ambition.

> Stars, hide your fires! 
> Let not light see my black and deep desires.
- After finding out that Duncan will be coming to his castle, Macbeth fantasises about murdering him and seizing the throne for himself. He wishes to obscure these thoughts from outside observers by asking the stars to hide darken.
- At this early point in the play Macbeth is still unsure whether or not he wants to go through with his plot to murder Duncan. He remains careful of his desires and has a sense of paranoia surrounding the threat of someone finding this out, therefore he calls upon the stars to "hide your fires" so that no one will see his "black and deep desires." The quote here plays upon common themes and metaphors of light and dark, however in this case the colours can be interpreted in a different way: black obviously alludes to his morally unscrupulousness, however 'light' does not stand in for an opposite. Rather it acts as a biblical allusion, where light is a stand in for an observer, in this case God, playing upon visions of God as a being of 'light.' Therefore it seems that Macbeth is less concerned about other human beings will spy his desires, but rather that he will receive some divine punishment because of it.
	- Desire obviously also means ambition.

> I have no spur 
> To prick the sides of my intent, but only 
> Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself 
> And falls on the other.
- Macbeth wonders whether or not he should follow through on his plan to kill Duncan. He observes that he is being motivated by aspirations of power, rather than responding to a specific injustice.
- Shakespeare here makes a subtle point about two different reasons why one would be impelled to act. The first is to have a "spur" or clear impetus for doing something, while the second is a more general "vaulting ambition." By describing the spur as something that can "prick the sides," Macbeth stresses how it is a narrow and specific stimulus; as a result it has a direct causal effect on his "intent." Ambition, on the other hand, tends to "o'erleap[] itself," meaning that it encourages one to act beyond his or her reasonable means. It overshoots a goal and as a result can have negative consequences.
- What is intriguing about this passage is that Macbeth seems keenly aware of his motivations and limitations. Though he may be acting out of "vaulting ambition," he is not immediately convinced by that desire. He can critically assess what stimulates him to act, and its likely consequences. Yet, at the same time, time he *will* ultimately ignore this scepticism and indeed "o"erleap" himself. Shakespeare thus gives a complex  presentation of human psychology, in which people may introspectively not the flaws of their motivations, while still falling prey to those very flaws.

>We fail? 
>But screw your courage to the sticking-place, 
>And we'll not fail.
- Lady Macbeth continues to convince Macbeth that they should kill Duncan. When he wonders whether they will actually succeed, she argues that with sufficient fortitude they will certainly triumph
- When Macbeth wonders whether they will fail, Lady Macbeth replies "We fail?" In contrast to Macbeth's hesitancy, she opts for an aggressive command--"screw your courage"--and an acerbic claim: "we'll not fail." Bravery and adherence to one's goals, in her opinion will ensure success.
- Their exchange insinuates two diverging views on human destiny: Whereas Macbeth attributes success to the whims of fates and prophecies, Lady Macbeth believes that humans themselves can select their own destiny. Her command "screw your courage to the sticking-place" implies that sufficient bravery will ensure success regardless of any external influence. Between these two characters, then, Shakespeare defines a spectrum of human relationships to destiny and personal agency--in which some attribute success to personal prowess while others see it as being out of one's own hands.

>Nought's had, all's spent 
>Where our desire is got without content.
- Lady Macbeth ponders why she continues to be dissatisfied with her existence. She acknowledges that she has had complete success in her endeavours but somehow remains vexed.
- These lines reveal a change in Lady Macbeth's disposition. Whereas before, she believed that he murder of Duncan would generate positive results, here she concludes the exact opposite. "Nought's had, all's spent" must be taken metaphorically--because Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have in fact achieved their goal of becoming king and queen. The line also elaborates on her disposition, where she feels that she has given everything that she can, but has received nothing in return. Lady Macbeth states that the trade-off of political power in exchange for "content," which we can take to mean "guilt-free contentment," wasn't at all worth it.
- Beyond revealing a growing dissatisfaction in Lady Macbeth, this passage makes a broader claim on the trappings of power and fame. Lady Macbeth points out that the status she had pursued does not in fact grant her happiness, but rather has brought her into greater misfortune. Thus Shakespeare uses her psychological anxiety as a way to illustrate the self-defeating natures of ambition and desire.

> By the pricking of my thumbs, 
> Something wicked this way comes.
- The witches prepare for Macbeth's arrival by mixing an unnatural brew in the cauldron. During their incantation, one makes this pronouncement on impending evil.
- These lines firstly verify the supernatural powers of the witches. They are able to sense from physical stimuli--"the pricking"--in their bodies that something "wicked" will take  place in the future. Although the audience might be sceptical of the actual mystical powers the witches possess, this image confirms that they have at least a limited capacity to see the future.  
- At the same time, by describing the wicked phenomenon as a separate external force--the phrasing of "this way comes" is a passive construction--the witches also present themselves as observers of fate, rather than active agents that bring certain events to pass. So while other human characters may see the witches as manipulative spirits willing bad events into existence, their actual incantations  show them to be mere bystanders and oracles of fate. ==The witches comment describes Macbeth as the wicked one, implying that while their prophecy may have been accurate, it was Macbeth's wickedness that caused him to pursue it as he did (or perhaps that his choice to pursue it as he did has made him wicked).==

> Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow 
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
> To the last syllable of recorded time; 
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 
> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player 
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, 
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
> Signifying nothing.
- As the final battle against Macduff's army approaches, Macbeth gives this moving soliloquy. He claims that life is an endless repetition and inherently meaningless.
- To arrive at this nihilistic conclusion, Macbeth first ponders the succession of day after day. He notes how monotonous they are with the repetition of "tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow," to the extent that life never seems to significantly shift. If the future holds nothing novel, the past is similarly devoid of meaning--only ever bringing indications of "dusty death" to come. Instead of hoping to grasp closely life's fleeting existence, however, Macbeth command sit to depart as rapidly as possible with the phrase "Out, out, brief candle!" His ambitious and cruel nature has thus culminated in a complete rejection of the significance to life itself: at the apex of his success, life has become to him nothing but a series of haphazard noises and commotions with no underlying meaning.
- Shakespeare brilliantly links this general pronouncement to the more specific case of reading and analysing literature. Alliterating "petty pace" and repeating "day to day" reiterates how repeating patterns appear in language as well as in time; casting time to be made of "syllables" presents it is a construction of language. Presenting humans as "a poor player" and his environment as "the stage" similarly makes the experience of theatre a metaphor for one's life in the world. Macbeth's "tale" becomes a symbol for the larger tale of human experience. Shakespeare makes a castigating self allusion with the phrase "told by an idiot," which shows that he has no greater access to truth or meaning than any of his readers. His text itself resists puree comprehension in that it is "sound and fury" alone--"signifying nothing" because no single meaning can be attributed to its characters or constructions. In this way, Shakespeare presents the finitude and emptiness of Macbeth's experience and the void of his language as a layered metaphor for each human's eventual demise.
