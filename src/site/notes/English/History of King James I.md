### Concept:
#### History of King James I
- Was a Scotsman who was elected to succeed Queen Elizabeth as the ruler of England and Ireland
- Done as a way to united Scotland, England and Ireland after decades of tension.
- However the move did not fully ease tensions and as such there were many attempted  assassinations
#### The Gunpowder Plot
- Attempted in the year 1605, probably don't need to explain what this is since we already know
- Macbeth was written a year after, and a major theme in the play is that of **punishment** for any form off treason, but especially regicide, so the play can be seen as a way to dissuade his audience from further acts of treason.
