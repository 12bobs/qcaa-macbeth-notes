- The story of Macbeth could be seen as a modern take on the fall of Adam & Eve
- In the classical story Eve is tempted by the devil disguised as a serpent, then goes onto tempt Adam, whereas in Macbeth, "Adam" gains knowledge from servants of the devil but is only betrays "God" once "Eve" pushes him to.
