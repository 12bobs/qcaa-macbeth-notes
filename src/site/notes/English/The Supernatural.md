### Concept:
#### The Supernatural
- Another major theme in Macbeth is the mysteries of fate and superstition.
- The most obvious example is the trio of witches, who add a sinister backdrop for play. Partly because of their androgyny, but mainly because of their willingness to dabble in the dark arts.
- We owe Macbeth's sudden ambition to become king to this supernatural influence. In Act I Scene V, Macbeth tells Lady Macbeth (in a letter):
	- "These weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that shalt be!'" - Macbeth, Act I Scene V, Lines 8-10
- Although Macbeth stills characterises them as 'Weird' he still taken by their prophecies. And later when he returns to them when things start going wrong in Act IV Scene I: 
	- "I conjure you, by that which you profess, Howe'er you come to know it, answer me: [...]" - Macbeth, Act IV Scene I, Lines 51-52
- The word "conjure" adding connotations of witchcraft, obviously fitting the witches, but also showing how much Macbeth now dabbles in the dark arts himself.
- At the time witchcraft would have been seen as a something quite disturbing. But, Macbeth's willingness to consort with "secret dark, and midnight hags" (Act IV, Scene I, Lines 48-49) would have made the audience wonder about Macbeth's sanity.
- It's concerning that he puts so much *Faith* in these predictions, to the point that in Act V SCene III, he genuinely believes that he's invincible:
	- "The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear." - Macbeth, Act V Scene III, lines 10-11
- By personifying his mind and heart with attributes of bravery, Shakespeare shows us that Macbeth is entirely fearless and convinced that his fate has been set in stone by the witches.

- In medieval times, it was believed that the health of a country was directly related to the ==goodness and moral legitimacy of its king.== If the King was good and just, then the nation would prosper as a result--if there was political order, than there would be natural order.
- Macbeth's fall into evil is characterised by his association with the supernatural (seen as evil due to [[English/Context for Shakespeare\|Context for Shakespeare]])

- After leaning that King Duncan will be staying at Macbeth's castle, she begins plotting his demise, asking the spirits to relinquish her of her human compassion to carry out the deed.
- Lady Macbeth believes that supernatural forces have a corruptive effect on human nature. She believes that they "tend on mortal thoughts" and will fill her "of the direst cruelty." Therefore she demands that she be overtaken by them as to. Implying that she wishes to act cruelly, however is unable to due to her human disposition.

>Out, damned spot! out, I say!
- Lady Macbeth has begun sleepwalking, and one night she says this.
- We can see the extent to which guilt has crippled Lady Macbeth's ability to live a normal life. Saying this lines shows that while she thought that before she could simply wash off Duncan's blood, now she cannot psychologically escape the blood, or in other words, the guilt of Duncan's murder. She obsessively repeats the action, demonstrating the extent to which the guilt weighs on her mind, as well as her fear that the "spot" could implicate her in the murder.

> Fair is foul, and foul is fair;
> Hover through the fog and filthy air. 
- In the plays opening scene, the three witches gather in a storm and discuss their upcoming meet with Macbeth. Together they chant these lines about the moral uncertainty and decay in Scotland.
- Both the phrase "Fair is foul," and "foul is fair" signify that everything is not what it seems, with that which is good instead being bad, and that which appears bad being good. Thus the witches point out the fickle quality of appearances--a recurring theme throughout the tragedy. This line is also an example of the rhetorical device of chiasmus: when elements are of a text are arranged in the form ABBA, with "A" being "Fair" and "B" being "foul." ==This device can have multiple meanings depending on the circumstances, but here it gives a rhythmical tone to the text, a theme that is used many times in relation to the supernatural to give it an otherworldly feel.==
	- example of how this is demonstrated throughout the play
- The image of "fog and filthy air" similarly foreshadows how the senses of characters will be confused, preventing them from correctly assessing what would be fair or foul. More generally, this image showcases how symbols and ethics will be mixed up in the tragedy. ==As supernatural creatures, the witches themselves seem decrepit and "foul" -- but their prophecies are also accurate, which would make them "fair."== These lines do not only make a distinction between the false appearance and honest reality, but rather question the very ability to determine the moral goodness of any such reality.
	- Shakespeare depicts the supernatural as being "foul", even if it has qualities of "fairness." probably relates back to [[English/Shakespeare and Religion\|Shakespeare and Religion]] due to the connotations that it had at the time.

>Is this a dagger which I see before me,

- Macbeth before murdering Duncan
- Beyond introducing the idea that Macbeth may be going insane, it also acts to further the theme of appearances versus reality. Macbeth may be fixating on a false vision, but the vision actually reveals to him a truth--for it is a portent of the murder to come. ==in a sense the "foul" vision is "fair" in that it is an accurate representation of reality, while not being real itself.== And when Macbeth does "draw" his own sword, he implies that it may even have a causal effect on his own actions. Shakespeare thus presents false visions not as figments of the imagination but as capable of inducing changes to reality itself.
	- drawing back to this idea of "fair is foul, and foul is fair."

>Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there, i’ th’ name of Beelzebub?
- said by the porter after the murder of king Duncan.
- Makes a biblical allusion to Beelzebub, otherwise known as Satan, where they are attempting to enter Macbeth's castle. By Satan attempting to enter Macbeth's domain after he murdered king Duncan, it signifies the point of no return for Macbeth, where the devil himself seeks council with him.

>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
>The instruments of darkness tell us truths, 
>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's 
>In deepest consequence.
- Macbeth and Banquo have just learned that Macbeth will become the thane of Cawdor, which confirms the first part of the witches prophecy, Banquo notes that the stories told by the witches may be an attempt to manipulate Macbeth.
- These lines pose an important question about the supernatural at the start of the play: are these men able to escape the witches prophecies, or are they bound by fate to walk down the road set before them? When Banquo says they "win us to our harm," he contends that the witches are actively exploiting him and Macbeth, yet he also note that they "tell us truths"--which would seem to imply that nothing they recount is false. The resolution comes in a similarly paradoxical phrase: "Honest trifles" that "betray." What Banquo means is that aspects of the witches prophecies are genuine, but that they are meant to instead play upon their better nature as a way to manipulate or "betray" themselves.
- Banquo thus argues that he and Macbeth should resist believing the witches too much, despite their prophecies being correct so far. This belief posits a worldview in which humans can act freely from the influence of supernatural forces--choosing to believe them or not. Macbeth, n the other hand, represents the position that direct adherence to their prophecies will allow him to thwart his fate. Shakespeare thus uses these two characters mixed responses to present two different ways of viewing the supernatural forces in his work: as either manoeuvring or merely recounting fate.

> Stars, hide your fires! 
> Let not light see my black and deep desires.
- After finding out that Duncan will be coming to his castle, Macbeth fantasises about murdering him and seizing the throne for himself. He wishes to obscure these thoughts from outside observers by asking the stars to hide darken.
- At this early point in the play Macbeth is still unsure whether or not he wants to go through with his plot to murder Duncan. He remains careful of his desires and has a sense of paranoia surrounding the threat of someone finding this out, therefore he calls upon the stars to "hide your fires" so that no one will see his "black and deep desires." The quote here plays upon common themes and metaphors of light and dark, however in this case the colours can be interpreted in a different way: black obviously alludes to his morally unscrupulousness, however 'light' does not stand in for an opposite. Rather it acts as a biblical allusion, where light is a stand in for an observer, in this case God, playing upon visions of God as a being of 'light.' Therefore it seems that Macbeth is less concerned about other human beings will spy his desires, but rather that he will receive some divine punishment because of it.
	- There's obviously a supernatural aspect to this. Macbeth has aligned himself with the witches, and thus must fear divine retribution. This also adds further proof the witches evil intentions; as, if they were not in fact evil then Macbeth would have nothing to fear.

> Look like the innocent flower, 
> But be the serpent under it.
-  Lady Macbeth entreats her husband to kill Duncan. She implores him to act secretly but strike violently.
- These lines return to the theme of appearance vs reality. While Macbeth is still uncertain as to whether or not to kill Duncan, Lady Macbeth is fully committed to the idea. She contrasts the image of the "innocent flower" with the active corruption of "the serpent," much like the witches mixed up "fair" and "foul" in the beginning of the play. For her however, this does not express a general predicament, but instead an outline to gain political power.
- Referencing a serpent is also a biblical allusion to the garden of Eden in the bible, in which a snake tempts Eve and leads to humanity's expulsion from paradise. This Christ reference is especially evocative of considering Lady Macbeth's engagement with supernatural paganism: just as she summoned the aid of fiends, Lady Macbeth symbolically asks her husband to strike out against Christian ideals--to take the role of a Biblical Villain.
	- This also directly parallels what occurs in the play, where after murdering Duncan, Satan is invited into Macbeth's castle, symbolising his fall from grace.

- [[English/Guilt\|Guilt]]
> Methought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more! 
> Macbeth does murder sleep, — the innocent sleep; 
> Sleep, that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care, 
> The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 
> Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, 
> Chief nourisher in life's feast.
- After murdering Duncan, Macbeth begins to feel remorse for what he has done. he fixates on a voice he claims to have overheard during the act, believing that it charges him with deep guilt.
- This quote servers to highlight Macbeth's continued descent into madness due to his growing guilt. His previous hallucinations that manifested due to his guilt have now progressed to the point where he is now able to hear them as well. Macbeth states that he heard "a voice cry, Sleep no more!" This line acts as a double entendre: not only has Macbeth murdered someone while they were in "the innocent sleep," but now with the guilt of having committed such a crime, Macbeth shall no longer be able to sleep. The quote goes onto describe the consequences that having committed this crime will have, such as, "the balm of hurt minds" and "sore labor's bath." By emphasizing these qualities, the audience can come to see the path towards insanity that Macbeth has placed himself on.
- Further explanation from Litcharts:
	- He imagines it to be a weaver who "knits up" or makes coherent and composed "the ravell'd sleave of care"--in which a "ravell'd sleave" is a messy and disorganized garment. This metaphor presents sleep as a tranquil and organising force that helps a person make coherent the chaos of life, that allows people to be coherent and calm. In the following lines, he casts sleep as the inverse or double to different types of daytime: the "death" after each "life"; the restful "bath" after one works; the "balm" to ease minds that may be overworked; a second sustenance after the meal of the day. These evocative images show how deeply Macbeth believes to have violated human life--for not only has he murdered Duncan but he has done so in an almost sacred space of sleeping rejuvenation. As Macbeth's obsessive thoughts on sleep proceed, an intimation exists too that "Sleep no more!" refers to the rampant guilt and madness that will descend now on Macbeth and his wife, in which because of their guilt, they will lose these healthful and necessary effects of sleep.

>Nought's had, all's spent 
>Where our desire is got without content.
- Lady Macbeth ponders why she continues to be dissatisfied with her existence. She acknowledges that she has had complete success in her endeavours but somehow remains vexed.
- These lines reveal a change in Lady Macbeth's disposition. Whereas before, she believed that he murder of Duncan would generate positive results, here she concludes the exact opposite. "Nought's had, all's spent" must be taken metaphorically--because Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have in fact achieved their goal of becoming king and queen. The line also elaborates on her disposition, where she feels that she has given everything that she can, but has received nothing in return. Lady Macbeth states that the trade-off of political power in exchange for "content," which we can take to mean "guilt-free contentment," wasn't at all worth it.
- Beyond revealing a growing dissatisfaction in Lady Macbeth, this passage makes a broader claim on the trappings of power and fame. Lady Macbeth points out that the status she had pursued does not in fact grant her happiness, but rather has brought her into greater misfortune. Thus Shakespeare uses her psychological anxiety as a way to illustrate the self-defeating natures of ambition and desire.

> By the pricking of my thumbs, 
> Something wicked this way comes.
- The witches prepare for Macbeth's arrival by mixing an unnatural brew in the cauldron. During their incantation, one makes this pronouncement on impending evil.
- ==These lines firstly verify the supernatural powers of the witches. They are able to sense from physical stimuli--"the pricking"--in their bodies that something "wicked" will take  place in the future. Although the audience might be sceptical of the actual mystical powers the witches possess, this image confirms that they have at least a limited capacity to see the future.==
- At the same time, by describing the wicked phenomenon as a separate external force--the phrasing of "this way comes" is a passive construction--the witches also present themselves as observers of fate, rather than active agents that bring certain events to pass. So while other human characters may see the witches as manipulative spirits willing bad events into existence, their actual incantations  show them to be mere bystanders and oracles of fate. The witches comment describes Macbeth as the wicked one, implying that while their prophecy may have been accurate, it was Macbeth's wickedness that caused him to pursue it as he did (or perhaps that his choice to pursue it as he did has made him wicked).
