### Concept:
#### Selflessness
- Selflessness was another significant value during the Jacobean era.
- Macbeth's selfish ambition is compared with Banquo, with his loyalty, kindness, and selflessness, where he is accepting of his social  status and not wanting to change it for himself.
- Despite being tempted by the same witches as Macbeth, he chides himself for entertaining the notion that he might gain power
	- "May they not be my oracles as well, And set my up in hope? But hush! no more." Banquo, Act III Scene I, Lines 9-10
- Again, we see Shakespeare setting up punishments for behaving in immoral ways. Where for Macbeth there is no greatness promised after his death. Instead, he loses his throne, his wife, and his life. Whereas Banquo is promised a great line of kings in his name for refusing to selfishly force himself into a position of power.
