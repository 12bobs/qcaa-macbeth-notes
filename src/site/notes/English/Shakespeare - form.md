### Concept:
#### 1. Shakespeare writes plays
- in dramas we must consider the the performance
	- Both the instructions and language should be considered 
#### 2. Blank verse
- Blank verse uses iambic pentameter
	- 10 syllables in each line, with stress on every second syllable
- There is no rhyming scheme
	- Lack of rhyming scheme is what makes this kind style of writing "blank"
- Iambic pentameter mimics everyday speech 
- By breaking the rule of no rhyming he adds emphasis to whatever is being said
- Noble characters speak in blank verses, whereas poor characters speak in prose, in order to emphasis the disparity between the two in intelligence and indicate social standing
#### How Shakespeare uses poetic form in Macbeth
- Sometimes Shakespeare would find a way to turn parameters into half-lines and share it between characters. This creates a sense of urgency and excitement.
	- Macbeth: Your children shall be kings.
	- Banquo: You shall be king.
	-- Macbeth and Banquo, Act 1 Scene III, Lines 89-90
- Shakespeare also manipulates **Prose form** to create certain effects, like:
	- Distinguishing the lower classes from the nobility.
	- Highlighting the deterioration of nobles, most clearly Lady Macbeth.
