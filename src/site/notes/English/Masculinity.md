### Concept:
#### Masculinity
- Masculinity is a key theme (usually projected by Lady Macbeth) whenever Macbeth falters in his ambitious streak, experiencing a moment of guilt or paranoia. The biggest question is: **In Macbeth, what does it mean to be a man**?
- In Act I Scene V, Lady Macbeth remarks that Macbeth is "too full o'th' milk of human kindness" to do what she thinks needs to be done (line 17). This metaphor suggests that Macbeth is feminine: in Lady Macbeth's eyes, he carries milk. Illuding to the fact that she believes that kindness is not aligned with masculinity
- After this, Lady Macbeth asks demonic spirits to "unsex" her and fill her with "direst cruelty" (Act i Scene V, Lines 48-50), demonstrating that Lady Macbeth believes that being a man requires cruelty, so as she loses her femininity, she will become more ruthless and brutal.
	- she must ask demonic spirits to unsex her as this would go against [[English/Christianity and the Chain of Being\|Christianity and the Chain of Being]].
- In Act I Scene VII, when the two are plotting to kill the king and Macbeth has second thoughts:
	- "When you durst do it, then you were am an; And, to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more than the man." - Lady Macbeth, Act I Scene VII, Lines 56-58
- Lady Macbeth emasculates him in order to manipulate him into killing the king, as by doing so he will 'be so much more the man.' This isn't the only time she emasculates him though. When Macbeth freaks out at the banquet in Act III, Scene IV, lady Macbeth slams him:
	- "Lady Macbeth: What, Quite unmann'd in folly?"
	- "Macbeth: if I stand here, I saw him."
	- "Lady Macbeth: Fie, for shame!"
	-- Act III Scene IV, Lines 88-90
- Lady Macbeth's derisive tone and cruel tone are intended to give him confidence, bravery and ruthlessness--all the things she believes makes a man. So we can see that Lady Macbeth insults  Macbeth's masculinity, and this inspires him to commit horrible crimes.
- Shakespeare's character foils show us that masculinity isn't just about being a savage brute. Shakespeare shows this via Macduff in Act IV Scene III. After Malcom tells him to avenge his family "like a man", Macduff essentially says that it's not a crime for a man to feel deeply:
	- "Malcolm: Dispute it like a man."
	- "Macduff: I shall do so; But I mut also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me."
	-- Act IV Scene III, Lines 259-63
- This contrasts clearly with Macbeth, who was convinced by Lady Macbeth to only dispute things "like a man". And, because of this contrast, we can see how far Macbeth has fallen.

> Come, you spirits

> And fill me from the crown to the toe, top-full 
> Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood, 
> Stop up the access and passage to remorse, 
> That no compunctious visitings of nature 
> Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between 
> The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, 
> And take my milk for gall.
- After leaning that King Duncan will be staying at Macbeth's castle, she begins plotting his demise, asking the spirits to relinquish her of her human compassion to carry out the deed.
- Lady Macbeth focuses on images relating to fertility and more generally bodily functions. That she implores "unsex me here", indicates that she believes that she cannot complete her task because of her gender, alluding to commonly held notions of the time that women were meant to be submissive, and caring, therefore by giving up her femininity for masculinity she will become more ruthless and cruel. Furthermore, by calling upon the spirits to "take [her] milk for gall," she is invoking a similar desire to give up something associated with femininity, milk, for something destructive and acidic, gall.

>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,

>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's 
>In deepest consequence.
- Macbeth and Banquo have just learned that Macbeth will become the thane of Cawdor, which confirms the first part of the witches prophecy, Banquo notes that the stories told by the witches may be an attempt to manipulate Macbeth.
- These lines pose an important question about the supernatural at the start of the play: are these men able to escape the witches prophecies, or are they bound by fate to walk down the road set before them? When Banquo says they "win us to our harm," he contends that the witches are actively exploiting him and Macbeth, yet he also note that they "tell us truths"--which would seem to imply that nothing they recount is false. The resolution comes in a similarly paradoxical phrase: "Honest trifles" that "betray." What Banquo means is that aspects of the witches prophecies are genuine, but that they are meant to instead play upon their better nature as a way to manipulate or "betray" themselves.
- Banquo thus argues that he and Macbeth should resist believing the witches too much, despite their prophecies being correct so far. This belief posits a worldview in which humans can act freely from the influence of supernatural forces--choosing to believe them or not. Macbeth, n the other hand, represents the position that direct adherence to their prophecies will allow him to thwart his fate. Shakespeare thus uses these two characters mixed responses to present two different ways of viewing the supernatural forces in his work: as either manoeuvring or merely recounting fate.

> I dare do all that may become a man; 
> Who dares do more, is none.
- Having decided against murdering Duncan, Macbeth finds his manhood being questioned by his wife. In response he argues that composure and allegiance are more characteristic of masculinity than rash violence.
- Macbeth says that he will only perform actions that "become a man"--a pun on "become" meaning both to become something, as well as a characteristic that proceeds ones character. In effect he is saying that his actions are made as a way to increase his manhood, but are also done as a way to give off the image of manhood, indicating that Macbeth does not see himself as fully masculine. Macbeth reasons, he would not be a man, for he would have overstepped the boundary of behaviours that define men. In this way, Macbeth describes manhood as a limit on his actions instead of a justification for more like Lady Macbeth.
- This passage returns to the theme of gender identities. Recall that Lady Macbeth renounced her womanhood earlier in Act 1, Scene 5 in order to disavow empathy and heartlessly pursue her goal of power. Yet in the lines after Macbeth's quote here, she asks Macbeth to do just the opposite with his gender: to maintain and embrace it. This contrast shows that she sees Manhood as equivalent to brute and rash action, whereas before that cruelty seemed to stem only from the supernatural or inhuman realm. Macbeth, however, unseats her opinion by defining manhood in terms of composure and clam intent. Shakespeare thus places the question of gender identity at the heart of this tragedy, presenting it as an ideological tool used by the characters to encourage each other to act more or less aggressively.

>We fail? 
>But screw your courage to the sticking-place, 
>And we'll not fail.
- Lady Macbeth continues to convince Macbeth that they should kill Duncan. When he wonders whether they will actually succeed, she argues that with sufficient fortitude they will certainly triumph
- When Macbeth wonders whether they will fail, Lady Macbeth replies "We fail?" In contrast to Macbeth's hesitancy, she opts for an aggressive command--"screw your courage"--and an acerbic claim: "we'll not fail." Bravery and adherence to one's goals, in her opinion will ensure success.
- Their exchange insinuates two diverging views on human destiny: Whereas Macbeth attributes success to the whims of fates and prophecies, Lady Macbeth believes that humans themselves can select their own destiny. Her command "screw your courage to the sticking-place" implies that sufficient bravery will ensure success regardless of any external influence. Between these two characters, then, Shakespeare defines a spectrum of human relationships to destiny and personal agency--in which some attribute success to personal prowess while others see it as being out of one's own hands.
