Thesis:
In Macbeth, Shakespeare contrasts the characters of Macbeth and Banquo to explore the tension between fate and free will. While both are presented with similar prophecies, their differing responses highlight the role of personal choice in shaping their fates, with Macbeth succumbing to ambition and Banquo choosing caution, emphasizing the moral consequences of each path.

- Point: Macbeth views the witches’ prophecies as an inevitable fate, but instead of waiting for destiny to unfold, he actively pursues power through immoral means, revealing his belief that he can manipulate fate through his own free will.
	- Quote 1: "If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, Without my stir." (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- The word "chance" symbolizes fate, but Macbeth’s decision to act or not act is a reflection of his free will. The phrase "without my stir" suggests the possibility of inaction, which he later abandons, proving that he chooses ambition over passivity.
		- This line reflects Macbeth's internal debate over whether to leave his future to fate or intervene to bring the prophecy to fruition. Although he contemplates leaving it to "chance," he later chooses to act, showing that his ambition ultimately drives his decisions. As is known from the results later in the play, Banquo's fate comes true, which most likely would have also occurred to Macbeth, however due to his ambition he instead takes fate into his own hands, ultimately leading to his demise.
	- Quote 2: "I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er." (Act 3, Scene 4)
		- Macbeth's metaphor of a "wading" through a pool of blood is representative of the violence that Macbeth has had to take in order to reach his position. The use of the word "wading" also points to the fact that it was because of Macbeth's own free will that he is now where he is; rather than having been pushed by fate, he has waded into this pit of violence.
		- Macbeth acknowledges that it is because of his own actions that he is in this predicament, however he believes that "should [he] wade no more" he could return, however to do so would require as much effort as to continue on his current path. His decision to instead continue killing rather than return to morality demonstrates how his belief in controlling fate has spiralled into destruction, driven by his own free will and ambition.
		- Shakespeare is making commentary on the violent nature of ambition, and the deadly consequences of going against Gods will.
	- Link to thesis: Macbeth’s decision to pursue power through murder contrasts with Banquo’s restraint, illustrating that while fate introduces opportunities, free will determines whether one chooses to act ethically or destructively.

- Point: In contrast to Macbeth, Banquo takes a more passive approach to the witches’ prophecies, choosing to let fate unfold without resorting to immoral actions, which reflects his cautious and ethical interpretation of destiny.
	- Quote 1: "If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate." (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- Banquo expresses curiosity about his fate, but unlike Macbeth, he neither begs nor fears the witches' prophecies. This cautious stance shows that while he is interested in his future, he does not believe in forcing fate through his own actions.
		- Banquo’s metaphor of "seeds of time" suggests that fate, like nature, takes its course, but cannot be forced to grow through human intervention. This reflects his belief that fate is something to be observed, not manipulated.
	- Quote 2: "Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none." (Act 1, Scene 3)
		- The witches predict that Banquo’s descendants will be kings, but unlike Macbeth, he does not take action to make this prophecy come true. His acceptance of fate without intervention contrasts sharply with Macbeth’s attempts to control his future.
		- The witches' prophecy gives Banquo the potential for future glory, yet his lack of action shows his trust in the natural unfolding of fate, unlike Macbeth’s immediate pursuit of power through violent means.
	- Link to thesis: Banquo’s passive approach to fate demonstrates his belief that destiny will unfold naturally, in contrast to Macbeth’s active manipulation of events. This dichotomy illustrates how Shakespeare uses these two characters to explore the moral implications of choosing between fate and free will.
