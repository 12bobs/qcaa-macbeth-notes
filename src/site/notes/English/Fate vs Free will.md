### Concept:
#### Fate vs Free will
- Fate: The idea of fate, is based on hindsight. Once something has happened, it's easy to say that it was destined to happen because, it has already happened.
- Free will: Free will is based on the idea of choice. If you come to a fork in the road, you may choose to go right or left.
- The witches' prophecies suggest that Macbeth is fated to become king.
- Macbeth kills Duncan of his own free will as well as Macbeth chooses to kill Banquo and to slaughter Macduff's family
- the witches prophecy, "All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!" which suggests destiny's control
- Macbeth's line, "If chance will have me king, who, chance may crown me," reflects his initial belief in fate.
- Key characters:
	- [[English/1. Macbeth\|1. Macbeth]]
	- [[English/2. Lady Macbeth\|2. Lady Macbeth]]
	- [[English/6. The Witches\|6. The Witches]]
- Skakespeaer's message is whether or not you should take matters into your own hands or let fate play out. It is a warning to let fate take control and to not try and do things on your own.

>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
>The instruments of darkness tell us truths, 
>Win us with honest trifles, to betray's 
>In deepest consequence.
- Macbeth and Banquo have just learned that Macbeth will become the thane of Cawdor, which confirms the first part of the witches prophecy, Banquo notes that the stories told by the witches may be an attempt to manipulate Macbeth.
- These lines pose an important question about the supernatural at the start of the play: are these men able to escape the witches prophecies, or are they bound by fate to walk down the road set before them? When Banquo says they "win us to our harm," he contends that the witches are actively exploiting him and Macbeth, yet he also note that they "tell us truths"--which would seem to imply that nothing they recount is false. The resolution comes in a similarly paradoxical phrase: "Honest trifles" that "betray." What Banquo means is that aspects of the witches prophecies are genuine, but that they are meant to instead play upon their better nature as a way to manipulate or "betray" themselves.
- Banquo thus argues that he and Macbeth should resist believing the witches too much, despite their prophecies being correct so far. This belief posits a worldview in which humans can act freely from the influence of supernatural forces--choosing to believe them or not. Macbeth, n the other hand, represents the position that direct adherence to their prophecies will allow him to thwart his fate. Shakespeare thus uses these two characters mixed responses to present two different ways of viewing the supernatural forces in his work: as either manoeuvring or merely recounting fate. 
	- Shakespeare is not offering a direct dichotomy in the sense that one character follows fate whereas the other follows free will, instead Shakespeare posits a dichotomy where both characters follow two different versions of fate.

>We fail? 
>But screw your courage to the sticking-place, 
>And we'll not fail.
- Lady Macbeth continues to convince Macbeth that they should kill Duncan. When he wonders whether they will actually succeed, she argues that with sufficient fortitude they will certainly triumph
- When Macbeth wonders whether they will fail, Lady Macbeth replies "We fail?" In contrast to Macbeth's hesitancy, she opts for an aggressive command--"screw your courage"--and an acerbic claim: "we'll not fail." Bravery and adherence to one's goals, in her opinion will ensure success.
- Their exchange insinuates two diverging views on human destiny: Whereas Macbeth attributes success to the whims of fates and prophecies, Lady Macbeth believes that humans themselves can select their own destiny. Her command "screw your courage to the sticking-place" implies that sufficient bravery will ensure success regardless of any external influence. Between these two characters, then, Shakespeare defines a spectrum of human relationships to destiny and personal agency--in which some attribute success to personal prowess while others see it as being out of one's own hands.
