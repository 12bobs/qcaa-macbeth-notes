#### General exam writing
>[!info]- note on doc copy
>Most of the stuff I say here was pretty much just a copy from the [[English/Essay structure\|Essay structure]], so you can probably just read that, but I'll put this here anyway.

- The main structure of your exam should be something like this:

- (A->B) generally your thesis should draw a connection between two points (A and B), which is vague enough where you should have to actually defend your thesis.

- (A->C->B) C in this case is your body paragraphs, where you elaborate on the connection and begin proving your thesis. The 'point' sentence in your body paragraphs should also be considered as a mini thesis, the point should draw the connection between A and B, but in order to actually prove that connection you should need your examples and analysis.
