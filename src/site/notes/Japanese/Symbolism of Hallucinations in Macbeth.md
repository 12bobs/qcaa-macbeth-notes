### Concept:
#### Symbolism of Hallucinations in Macbeth
- Throughout the play, Macbeth sees and/or hears various strange things: the floating dagger, the voice that says he's murdering sleep, and Banquo's ghost just to name a few. As Macbeth wonders himself about the dagger, are these sights and sounds supernatural vision or figments of his guilty conscience. The play makes no definitive answer, which itself almost answers the question: they're both. Macbeth is a man at war with himself, his innate [[English/Honour and bravery\|Honour and bravery]] battling his ambition. Just as nature goes haywire when the natural order of things is ruptured. Macbeth's mind does the same thing when it's force to battle against itself.

> Fair is foul, and foul is fair;
> Hover through the fog and filthy air. 
- In the plays opening scene, the three witches gather in a storm and discuss their upcoming meet with Macbeth. Together they chant these lines about the moral uncertainty and decay in Scotland.
- Both the phrase "Fair is foul," and "foul is fair" signify that everything is not what it seems, with that which is good instead being bad, and that which appears bad being good. Thus the witches point out the fickle quality of appearances--a recurring theme throughout the tragedy. This line is also an example of the rhetorical device of chiasmus: when elements are of a text are arranged in the form ABBA, with "A" being "Fair" and "B" being "foul." This device can have multiple meanings depending on the circumstances, but here it gives a rhythmical tone to the text, a theme that is used many times in relation to the supernatural to give it an otherworldly feel.
- The image of "fog and filthy air" similarly foreshadows how the senses of characters will be confused, preventing them from correctly assessing what would be fair or foul. More generally, this image showcases how symbols and ethics will be mixed up in the tragedy. As supernatural creatures, the witches themselves seem decrepit and "foul" -- but their prophecies are also accurate, which would make them "fair." These lines do not only make a distinction between the false appearance and honest reality, but rather question the very ability to determine the moral goodness of any such reality.

>Is this a dagger which I see before me, 
>The handle toward my hand? 
>Come, let me clutch thee; 
>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. 
>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 
>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but 
>A dagger of the mind, a false creation, 
>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? 
>I see thee yet, in form as palpable 
>As this which now I draw
- Macbeth before murdering Duncan
- A primarily psychological analysis of this lines would reveal the first signs of Macbeth's insanity. His inability to distinguish between a physical and imaginary dagger does not prevent him from hoping to "clutch" either one. When he cannot, he notes that it is impossible to "have" the vision, and yet that he can still "see" it, and is confused why his sense of sight and touch do not accord. Macbeth recognises the conditions of his sanity, observing that his "heat-oppressed brain" may be responsible for creating the illusion, or in other words he thinks his guilt may be causing him to see things. Yet after noting this he still reiterates the "palpable" nature of the dagger, comparing it to the physical world.
- Beyond introducing the idea that Macbeth may be going insane, it also acts to further the theme of appearances versus reality. Macbeth may be fixating on a false vision, but the vision actually reveals to him a truth--for it is a portent of the murder to come. in a sense the "foul" vision is "fair" in that it is an accurate representation of reality, while not being real itself. And when Macbeth does "draw" his own sword, he implies that it may even have a causal effect on his own actions. Shakespeare thus presents false visions not as figments of the imagination but as capable of inducing changes to reality itself.
