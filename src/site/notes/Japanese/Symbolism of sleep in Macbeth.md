### Concept:
#### Symbolism of sleep in Macbeth
- When he murders Duncan, Macbeth thinks he hears a voice say "Macbeth does murder sleep". Sleep symbolizes innocence, purity, and peace of mind, and in killing Duncan Macbeth actually does murder sleep: Lady Macbeth begins to sleepwalk, and Macbeth is haunted by his nightmares.

- After murdering Duncan, Macbeth begins to feel remorse for what he has done. he fixates on a voice he claims to have overheard during the act, believing that it charges him with deep guilt.
- This quote servers to highlight Macbeth's continued descent into madness due to his growing guilt. His previous hallucinations that manifested due to his guilt have now progressed to the point where he is now able to hear them as well. Macbeth states that he heard "a voice cry, Sleep no more!" This line acts as a double entendre: not only has Macbeth murdered someone while they were in "the innocent sleep," but now with the guilt of having committed such a crime, Macbeth shall no longer be able to sleep. The quote goes onto describe the consequences that having committed this crime will have, such as, "the balm of hurt minds" and "sore labor's bath." By emphasizing these qualities, the audience can come to see the path towards insanity that Macbeth has placed himself on.
- Further explanation from Litcharts:
	- He imagines it to be a weaver who "knits up" or makes coherent and composed "the ravell'd sleave of care"--in which a "ravell'd sleave" is a messy and disorganized garment. This metaphor presents sleep as a tranquil and organising force that helps a person make coherent the chaos of life, that allows people to be coherent and calm. In the following lines, he casts sleep as the inverse or double to different types of daytime: the "death" after each "life"; the restful "bath" after one works; the "balm" to ease minds that may be overworked; a second sustenance after the meal of the day. These evocative images show how deeply Macbeth believes to have violated human life--for not only has he murdered Duncan but he has done so in an almost sacred space of sleeping rejuvenation. As Macbeth's obsessive thoughts on sleep proceed, an intimation exists too that "Sleep no more!" refers to the rampant guilt and madness that will descend now on Macbeth and his wife, in which because of their guilt, they will lose these healthful and necessary effects of sleep.
