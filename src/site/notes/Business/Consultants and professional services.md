# Consultants and professional services
## Consultants
- Provide specific advice on specific areas of a business.
- They may:
	- Find opportunities to differentiate a business from its competitors
	- Examine a business's processes to find improvements that will assist future growth
	- Complete a cost-benefit analysis to determine opportunities for growth
	- Determine strategies to regain market share
	- Identify ways to reduce costs--for example, by downsizing operations.
## Professional services
- Are external to the business.
- Offer specific knowledge to a business and are experts in their field.
- They provide a service to a business and are accountable for their actions--unlike a consultant, who only provides advice.
- Professional service providers include:
	- Lawyers - experts on legal matters. Lawyers could represent a business in the post-maturity stage on matters such as bankruptcy filings or restructuring a company structure.
	- Accountants - experts on financial matters. A business in the post-maturity stage could seek the services of an accountant for insolvency or business recovery.
