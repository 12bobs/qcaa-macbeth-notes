### Concept:
#### Organisational structure
- it is a system that outlines the roles and responsibilities and the different levels of management.
- The organisational structure can be a driver of change. As the business changes, organisations may need to examine and modify their structure. For example, a business's organisational structure would need to be changed with
	- Changes in ownership structure - acquiring, or merging with, another company
	- Operational changes - reorganising internal functions to improve business operations
	- Business growth - expanding to an international market
	- Economic downturn - downsizing a business due to the economic environment.
- Structural changes in a business  can include changes to the organisations' hierarchy, chain of command, management system and job structure. An organisation  may require more, fewer or different managers, or may need to change existing strategies to realign its objectives.
