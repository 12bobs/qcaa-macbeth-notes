### Concept:
#### Participation strategies
- If employees are involved in change initiatives, the perception is they have a greater sense of control during the process. 
- When employees are engaged in opportunities to contribute their ideas, suggestions and express their concerns or fears, the whole organisation can benefit.
- Furthermore, the act of participation can itself be motivation, which leads to greater incentive and effort to make the change happen.
- Direct participation of employees can play a vital role in creating a positive work environment and contribute to the [[Business/Corporate culture\|Corporate culture]]. Providing employees with opportunities to contribute to decisions, where their opinions are heard, will create an environment in which employees feel empowered, valued and their opinions matter.
- Examples:
	- Staff meetings where staff can ask questions and/or volunteer for tasks
