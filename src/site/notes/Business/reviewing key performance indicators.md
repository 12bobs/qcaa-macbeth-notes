### Concept:
#### reviewing key performance indicators
- KPIs help an organisation define and measure progress towards organisational goals.
- KPIs are quantifiable measurements that show success factors.
- They use specific criteria such as efficiency and effectiveness to measure performance.
- KPIs assist an organisation during transformation by defining, measuring and progressing towards  the organisational change.
-  The performance during the transformation is measured and then the performance is evaluated 
	- Strategize - the objectives are established: *What do we want to achieve?*
	- Measure - the progress is measured: *How are we going?*
	- Evaluate - the performance is assessed: *Did we achieve the objective*
- When a business is undergoing transformation, performance management is clearly under the spotlight.
- Measurement using KPIs can assist by:
	- motivating employees to perform
	- providing guidance towards goal achievement
	- alerting management to the risk of resistance
- There is a variety of data that can be gathered to assist a business to evaluate performance
