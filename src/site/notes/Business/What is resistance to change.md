### Concept:
#### What is resistance to change
- For a business to remain competitive it must constantly review its operations and make changes to meet the need within an industry. 
- When dealing with change, it is inevitable that there will be barriers off resistance.
- Expecting resistance to change will assist a business to effectively manage any objections.
- Resistance can slow down, delay or even stop the change process, obstruct the implementation of the change and could even increase its costs. It can take a number of forms, such as:
	- Employee apathy
	- Reduction in output
	- Hostility in the workplace
	- Employees taking strike action
	- Increased number of employees 'quitting'.
- If resistance exists, it provides an opportunity for a business to reassess the change and receive feedback prior to implementation of the change.
- This allows a business to act accordingly to create a 'best fit' for the situation, employees and ultimately the business.
