### Concept:
#### Lewin's change theory and model
- Lewin's model of change is based on the theory of a change process. he uses the analogy of changing the shape of an ice cube. The process involves these steps:
	- Unfreeze - melt the ice cube so it can be changed 
	- Change - mould the iced water into a desired shape
	- Refreeze - solidify into the new desired shape.
#### Step 1: Unfreeze
- In this stage the business needs to communicate and prepare for the change. To do this, a business must develop a convincing message that clearly shows the necessity for change.
- For example, a business in the post-maturity stage could frame the message for change due to:
	- declining sales
	- poor financial results
	- lack of customer satisfaction
- This stage is perhaps the most difficult, as it involves preparing the organisation, including its stakeholders, to accept the change and then adopt the change. This can create strong emotions such as denial, uncertainty and doubt within a business.
- It is crucial that clear communication and involvement happens at this stage so that employees are more willing to accept the new change of direction.

#### Step 2: Change
- This is the implementation step and requires stakeholders to embrace the change for it to be effective.
- It is essential, though, that the change is implemented within a short time. The longer it takes to make the change, the more likely it becomes that it will not be accepted.
- it is also important that there is strong leadership, direction and communication at the change stage.
-  Strategies
	- Communicate often

	- Involve people in the process

#### Step 3: Refreeze
- the change becomes permanent and stability is regained. Again, there needs to be strong leadership to institutionalise the change.
- there also needs to be checks, monitoring and evaluation of the changes, and adjustments made if necessary.
-  Strategies
	- Provide ongoing support
	- Anchor the changes into the culture
	- Develop ways to sustain the change
	- Celebrate success
