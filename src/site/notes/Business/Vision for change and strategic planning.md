### Concept:
- When businesses decide to undergo change, they should have visions for what that change should be.
- The vision for change is a motivator for stakeholders and is essential to the success of the change.
- Strategic plans should be used in order to decide how the change should be constructed.
- The vision for change is the 'why' for the change and the strategic plan is the 'how for implementing the change
Vision for change (why) + Strategic plan (how) = Change
