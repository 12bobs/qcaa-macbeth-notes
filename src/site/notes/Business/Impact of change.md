### Concept:
#### Impact of change
- Change is about moving from one state to a different, desired state.
- The current state is where the process begins
- The future state is where the organisation strives to be.
- In the middle is the transition process.
- In order to understand and manage change, a business needs to examine the impact of change.
- If the impact of change is overlooked or minimised, a business may fail to achieve its desired outcome off change.
