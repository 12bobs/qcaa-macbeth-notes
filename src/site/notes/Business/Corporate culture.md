### Concept:
#### Corporate culture
- Corporate culture refers to the shared values, attitudes and beliefs that characterise members of an organisation and guide its practices.
- Corporate culture is driven by the top leaders in a business and becomes embedded through processes, rewards systems and behaviours.
- There is a clear link between  corporate culture and the performance of a business.
- A strong corporate culture can improve the performance of a business by motivating employees and creating an effective and efficient work environment.
- Driving corporate cultural change requires a business to consider the following actions:
	1. Assess the current culture of the business
		The first step in change is knowing what employees value in a business. This will provide a business with information about how to implement a change.
	2. Revisit the strategic vision of the business
		The strategic vision of a business is closely connected with the corporate culture. Therefore, before initiating a change, the strategic vision should be considered.
	3. Communicate again and again
		Communication is the key. It is necessary to send a clear and structured message to about the change. Frequent communications is necessary during the change process.
	4. Lead and manage.
		Leadership effectiveness is critical in change. Leaders who are dedicated to change are one of the most prominent success factors in change. It is the job of management to harness the corporate culture of a business to build momentum and create the change. A business that is able to do this will have a greater chance of success in initiating change.
