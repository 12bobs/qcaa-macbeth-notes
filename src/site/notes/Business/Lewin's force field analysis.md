### Concept:
#### Lewin's force field analysis
- Lewin also developed a change model called **force field analysis**, which aims to assist management in implementing a change.
- He suggests that in any change there will be driving forces and restraining forces that will resist, a proposed change.
#### Driving forces
- [[Business/Drivers of change\|Drivers of change]] are those factors  that bring about change. They are forces that initiate and compel change. 
- A driving force can apply pressures for a change to occur and can encourage and support the change occurring.
- When **driving forces** are more **dominant** in a business, the change is likely to be **successful**.
- If the **driving forces** are met by **restraining forces** at a **similar level**, it is likely that the change will **not be successful**. 
#### Restraining forces
- [[Business/Resistance to change\|Resistance to change]] act to block the [[Business/Drivers of change\|Drivers of change]]. They make the change process more difficult to implement and can lead to resistance to change. 
- Restraining forces can include fear, apathy, lack of training and hostility.
- If the **restraining forces** are more **powerful** than the **driving forces**, the **unlikely** that the **change will be successful**.
#### The concept of a force field analysis
- The concept of a force field analysis is that a situation is maintained by equilibrium between two forces, a driving force and a restraining force. For the situation to change, either a driving force must be strengthened or a restraining force weakened.
#### Creating a force field analysis
1. determine the change
2. brainstorm the driving forces
3. brainstorm the restraining forces
4. evaluate the driving and restraining forces by rating each force. The score is a method of ranking the forces listed from the mots influential (5) to the least (1)
5. create a strategy to strengthen the driving forces or weaken the restraining forces
6. plan of action. Create a list of steps to achieve the desired outcome.
