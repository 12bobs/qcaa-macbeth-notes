### Concept:
#### Redundancy
- Redundancy occurs within an organisation when a position is no longer required. This means the employee performing that position is dismissed when their role becomes redundant.
- A redundancy could occur in a business due to:
	- Technological change
	- Restructuring or reorganising
	- Business downturn due to low sales or production
	- A merger or acquisition.
- When a business is undergoing transformational change, performance management will determine workforce employment requirements. 
- If an employee's position is no longer required due to the change, a redundancy could be offered
- Redundancy playouts would need to be made for departing employee.
- Redundancies have a significant impact on an organisation and the corporate culture. Not only will they incur a large payment by a business; they also affect the morale of staff.
- Two important considerations are:
	- The quality and clarity of communication regarding redundancies
	- The treatment of the employees being made redundant
- The process must be well managed to avoid trauma to the remaining staff.
- Clearly communication is crucial to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations of decisions.
- When communication is not clear, remaining employees may create their own version of events, which can impact negatively on staff morale.
- If the situation is handled poorly, other employees may reconsider their employment within the organisation.
