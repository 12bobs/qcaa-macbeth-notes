### Concept:
#### Financial management strategies
- Financial strategies are initiatives aimed at improving the financial function within an organisation.
- This involves a variety of tasks, from improving the budgeting cycle to implementing a new accounting software program to reduce overhead costs.
- These strategies for transforming a business must align to the business's overall strategy in order to become more effective and efficient
- Typically finance strategies will cover two core areas--profitability and growth.
#### Profitability
- The focus of a business should be on minimising costs to maximise profits.
- When a business changes the core responsibilities of financial management, it does so to reduce costs.
- The financial manager must initiate strategies to budget for additional expenses and control financial resources.
- Managing costs is essential during transformation, therefore a business should set targets and forecasts using industry benchmarks.
- These plans need to be revised frequently during the transformation period to ensure outcomes are achieved
#### Growth
- During a time of transformational change, business requirements could change due to new markets, acquisitions or mergers.
- The goal for the financial manager is to be able to efficiently integrate the growing business. 
- The manager needs to have financial insight to manage the change.
- The following financial strategies could improve the overall financial position and cash flow:
	- Selling assets - selling assets that are no longer used in the business
	- Improving cash flow - following up on outstanding customer payments; taking out a business loan
	- Increasing prices - if a change has occurred in a business, this could coincide with a change in product or service prices
	- Reducing expenses - changing suppliers, modifying the quantity of stock purchased, switching to cheaper alternatives for consumables
