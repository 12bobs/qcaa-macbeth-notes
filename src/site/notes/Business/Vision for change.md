### Concept:
#### Vision for change
- Is not the same as a [[vision statement\|vision statement]].
- It is a desired future state for the business for after the change has been made.
- Creates a vision for where the business should go from now (past) , to where it should be in the future (future).
- It should be easy to understand, as it needs to provide the organisation with a picture what the future business should look like, and why that change will benefit the business.
- The vision should be seen as a guiding document that articulates  the following:
	- *Reason* - to understand and explain the need for change.
	- *Motivation* - To inspire and set a goal to work towards
	- *Unity* - to show how a cohesive effort is required to achieve the end goal.
- Without a vision for change, the effort to change could lack direction and fail to achieve its goal.
- [[Business/The role of leadership and management in change\|The role of leadership and management in change]]
#### Strategic planning for change
- About defining the overall purpose and goal of a business and determining how results will be achieved.
- Is about the process of establishing a direction for an organisation of where priorities are set, resources are allocated and operations strengthened to ensure stakeholders are working towards a common goal. 
- The strategic plan should consider three key aspects of the change:
	- *Content* - this refers to what needs to change. It should be the structure, system, technology, processes, products, services or socio-cultural aspects of the business.
	- *Process* - a plan for how to achieve the change. It  shows how the change will be implemented and the direction it will take
	- *People* - those impacted by the change. This is the human element of the change and includes people's mindset, emotional reaction, behaviour, engagement and the cultural dynamics impacted by the change.
