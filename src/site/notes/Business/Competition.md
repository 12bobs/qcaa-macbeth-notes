### Concept:
#### Competition
- A business needs to understand and monitor its competitors. 
- This includes knowing competitors' strengths and weaknesses, monitoring changes in the industry, and understanding customers' needs. 
- A business must  stay up to date with what competitors are doing and how they are responding to customers needs.
- it needs to respond quickly to market trends and competition and implement changes to gain a sustainable competitive edge.
- A SWOT analysis can be a useful tool in understanding and assessing a business's competition.
- It can help a business to build on strengths, minimise weaknesses, seize opportunities and counteract threats.
- By completing an analysis of the market in relation to competitors it can help a business to review its strategies and enhance its competitive advantage.
- competition can have a direct impact on a business and can be a driver of change. Examples can include:
	- Pricing - the pricing policy used by a competitor can influence change in a business. If a competitor is selling that same product at a lower price, this may lead a business to change its pricing policy, too.
	- Advertising - the promotional material or advertising cmapaign used by a business can trigger a change, especially if its marketing is more engaging
	- Product - a change in product quality or production method can drive a competitor to change its product or process
	- Technology - the use of new technology can have a significant impact on business operations and influence change. It can increase the  speed of production, improve communication or change operational process in a business 
	- New business - new competitors that will compete with an existing business may result in changes. The existing business may need to change to keep competitive.
