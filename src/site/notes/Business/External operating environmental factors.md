### Concept:
#### Customers
- With the rapid evolution of technology, customers are better informed and have more options available. Therefore a business must prioritise creating a culture that is customer-focused and customer-centric to stay in tune with customer expectations.
#### Competitors
- Businesses must respond and change their operations to match or stay ahead of the competition. 
- For example, the actions of a competitor may force a business to reassess its operations and implement changes. 
- These could include:
	- being the lowest-cost supplier in an industry
	- offering innovative products or services
	- finding a niche in the market
	- using different approaches
#### Suppliers
- A business is reliant on its suppliers to provide the necessary resources for it to function. 
- Any change affecting the  supplier can have a significant impact on a business
- A business requires suppliers that are reliable and competitively priced to ensure the success of its operations.
