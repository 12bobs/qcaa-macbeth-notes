### Concept:
#### Manipulation strategies
- Manipulation, in the context of organisational change, is the skilful handling of someone - or, sometimes, the scheming exercise of influence over them - to achieve a desired outcome.
- this could include manipulating information or deviously exerting influence over employees to force the change. 
- For example, an organisation can offer promotional opportunities as an enticement for implementing change. In this situation employees are being manipulated to accept the change by being offered an incentive.
- Manipulation provides a leader with the ability to manage resistance quickly; however, there is a significant risk it will have negative consequences. 
- A leader might, for example, manipulate change and gain support by only communicating the benefits of a change and not identifying the negatives. 
- This practice can harm the morale and the [[Business/Corporate culture\|Corporate culture]] of a business if the employees find out they have been manipulated.
- Examples:
	- Leak information
	- Provide only some of the facts
