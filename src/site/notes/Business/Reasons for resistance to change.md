| Unknown       | If employees do not understand the reason for change, a business can expect resistance. Employees will be reluctant to adopt a change if they are unaware of the reason for change. Additionally, not knowing the impact of change on the future of a business or an employee's job status or prosects can cause anxiety. This creates resistance to change.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fear          | One of the most common reasons for resistance to change is fear of failure. An employee who is required to acquire new skills may fear failure and be resistant to undertake the change. This can cause fear among employees, which often results in resistance to change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Trust         | Trust is vital when operating a successful business. In a business where trust in management is positive, there is less resistance to change. When employees don't have trust in management to implement change, there is likely to be resistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| communication | If change is not clearly communicated to all stakeholders, it will not be accepted. This is a reason why employees oppose change. Furthermore, how the change is communicated to employees is also very important because it will determine how they react. These lines of communication need to be fluent during the change process. This includes communicating the change process, how the change will be implemented and what the change will achieve. If this is not communicated clearly, resistance can be expected. |
| Timing        | The timing of change is crucial to it being implemented successfully. it could be that insufficient time has been allocated for the change. Employees may not have been given enough time to consider the change, accept the change and execute the change. It could be a business has not take n the time to plan for the change. Or if there are too many changes  at one time it may create a state of chaos, which can cause resistance.                                                                                |
