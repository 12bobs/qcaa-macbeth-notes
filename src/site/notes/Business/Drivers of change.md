### Concept:
#### drivers of change
- Change remains constant and is one of the most significant and demanding issues  a business is likely to face.
- As the business environment changes, an organisation must adapt if it is to be successful. 
- For a business to effectively manage change, it must examine the driving forces that initiate change and be proactive in its approach to change.
- This means that a business should lead the change and initiate strategies to embrace the change.
