### Concept:
#### Impact on suppliers
- Change my also impact on the suppliers used by a business, as a business may change their methods of production after the change.
- This will result in changes to suppliers and a business may need to:
	- renegotiate existing contracts with suppliers to match the change 
	- source new suppliers from local, national or international areas
	- outsource methods of production, resulting in changes to the supply chain
