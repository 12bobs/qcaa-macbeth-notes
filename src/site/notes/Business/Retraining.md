### Concept:
#### Retraining
- Investing in retraining and 'upskilling' existing workers is an urgent priority after transformation in a business.
- After a transformation, employees need to learn new skills. 
- For example, a business that upgrades to new technology may require retraining to employees to use new devices or software.
- Retraining programs can be beneficial both to employees and to the business.

| Retraining programs update skills and provide a continuous learning program for employees | Retraining in new skills increases overall productivity, which can increase products and services provided |
| Employee skill set is developed, which improves workplace outcomes and motivation         | Having more highly skilled employees increases workplace efficiencies                                      |
- However, retraining programs can be costly to a business, and some employees may be reluctant to participate in training programs. 

| Disadvantages to an employee                                                  | Disadvantages to a business                                                     |

| Employees may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in retraining programs | Retraining employees is expensive and may not always achieve the desired result |
| Retraining may require employees to work longer hours to upskill              | Retraining hinders a workplace from recruiting new people                       |
- The business needs to evaluate the potential benefits against the costs to determine if the retraining is financial viable.
- This may require a business to consider the long-term impacts that the retraining will provide.
