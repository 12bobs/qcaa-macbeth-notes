		- Connect the employee performance to the change objectives
		- Clarify the duties and responsibilities associated with the change
		- Provide clear direction that links the objectives with the change
	- Stage 2: Monitoring and reviewing progress towards achieving these objectives
		- Use performance appraisal to measure performance during change.
		- Use performance appraisal to provide feedback to individuals on their progress
		- Assess achievements, strengths and weaknesses of managing change.
	- Stage 3: Reinforcing desired outcomes by providing feedback
		- Link the objectives of the change to the performance results of an employee
		- Provide feedback and incentives on the results achieved and show the link to the change objective
		- Reward behaviours required for the change to be achieved
	- Stage 4: Identify needs
