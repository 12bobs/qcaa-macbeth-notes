### Concept:
#### Threat strategies
- This tactic consists of making direct threats to those who resist change.
- Threat involves forcing employees to accept the change or receive retribution or some form of negative punishment. 
- Possible threats could include demotion, transfer or loss of employment. 
- The strategy of using threat is to create fear in the hope that employees will embrace the change quickly.
- This can cause resentment as employees are forced to accept the change.
- Using threat can also impact on the [[Business/Corporate culture\|Corporate culture]] within an organisation by harming relationships.
- A leader may resort to using the strategy of threat to overcome resistance to change when they cannot invest the time or effort required by suing other tactics.
