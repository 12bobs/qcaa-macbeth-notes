### Concept:
#### Communication strategies
- To achieve support, cooperation, involvement and commitment from stakeholders, it is crucial that open and effective communication occurs throughout the change process. 
- This is one of the most challenging issues when implementing change. 
- It is a matter of communicating the right information to the right people at the right time with the right messages using the right engagement strategies.
- It involves informing all stakeholders through a variety of mediums at various stages through the change process.
- These communication methods may include:
	- Face-to-face conversations
	- Written communication such as emails or reports
	- Informal discussions or meetings
	- Formal discussions, meetings or conferences.
- Utilising several different ways to communicate during change will reinforce the message and highlight the vision and expectations of the change.
- To overcome resistance to change, an effective communication strategy, using a range of communication channels, needs to be developed to move stakeholders along the change process.
- The communication continuum strategy will influence stakeholders in building commitment towards the change and achieve the desired outcomes. The communication continuum includes:
	- Awareness - communicate the change. Individuals are conscious of the change and will start to consider the change.
	- Understanding - communicate the reason for the change. Individuals will understand the reason, benefits, impact on them and their role in the change.
	- Acceptance - communicate the need to assent to the change. Individuals are ready to implement the change, they are involved and feeling empowered to commit and engage in the desired change
	- Alignment - communicate the level of support provided during the change. Individuals are aware of the support they will receive throughout the change process
	- Commitment - communicate the dedication required to implement the change. Individuals take ownership and responsibility for the implementation of the change.
- Examples:
	- Staff meetings, where information is reported
	- Emails
	- Newsletters
