### Concept:
#### Impact on customers
- when a business undergoes change, customers could be affected.
- customers may resist the change, embrace the change or even promote the change.
- This may require a business to target new customers or reconnect with existing customers. A business may need to:
	- Introduce new advertising campaigns to inform customers
	- re-establish existing customers by offering incentives or rewards
	- target new customers
