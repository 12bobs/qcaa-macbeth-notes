#### Challenges for the post-maturity stage
- If the business enters a decline state or the owners choose to close the business, the financial and psychological challenges of a business loss can have a significant impact on founders and owners.
- While being in steady state, or decline, being able to come up with a renewal plan can be challenging.
#### Strategies for the post-maturity stage
- Having a transition business plan formulated with the input of professionals and financial advisers is essential.
- A business in steady state cannot maintain this state forever, so must adopt repositioning strategies to secure injections of revenue, such as by reducing production or operation costs.
