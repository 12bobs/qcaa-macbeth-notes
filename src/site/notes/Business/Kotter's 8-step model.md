- Kotter's approach aims to improve an organisation's ability to change and to increase tits chances of success.
- The first three steps of Kotter's model are about creating the climate for change.
- Steps four to six link the change to the organisation through engagement and enabling key stakeholders.
- The final two stages, are aimed at the implementation of the changes to achieve success.
- The greatest strength of the model is that the process is an easy step-by-step method.
- it focuses on preparing for and accepting change, rather than on the change itself.
